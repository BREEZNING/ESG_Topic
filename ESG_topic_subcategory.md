Design/methodology/approach The present study collected data from 438 individual equity investors from the North Indian region. To achieve the objectives of the study, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (Fuzzy AHP) was applied. The key considerations of the study were environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Findings The governance criterion was discovered to be the most significant factor influencing individual equity investors investment decisions among the three ESG factors, followed by environmental criteria, while social criteria were shown to be the least influential. Research limitations/implications The present study solely looked at ESG issues as drivers of stock investors investment decisions. In the current world, however, many other factors, including behavioral biases, accounting information, ownership structure and fundamental analysis, can have a substantial influence on investors investment decisions. Practical implications The studys findings widen the theoretical contribution in the field of responsible investment by asserting how ESG factors influence investors investment decisions in the equity market. From a practical standpoint, this study applies to retail and institutional investors, portfolio managers, financial advisors, market regulators, corporations and society at large. Originality/value To the best of authors knowledge, no attempt has been made to prioritize the ESG issues that impact the investment decisions of individual equity investors. Ergo, this study contributes to the existing literature on socially responsible investment.", "The past few decades have seen a marked increase in socially responsible investing (SRI), an investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in the decision-making process. While there has been substantial investment and research in predominantly advanced economies, we have seen striking growth in key Asian markets in recent years, suggesting broader proliferation of more responsible corporate and investment practices. Because socially responsible investors take both financial and social considerations into account when allocating investments, this raises questions about the viability of SRI as an investment strategy and motivations behind individuals and institutions engaging in it. To investigate this further, this study analyses the emergence of the SRI market in South Korea given very public corporate governance concerns following the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and recent visibility of SRI investments by the countrys largest institutional investor, the National Pension Service (NPS). This study contributes to corporate governance and new institutionalist theory by highlighting that the need to address gaps in corporate governance has served as an important motivation for investment and research institutions to enhance socially responsible investments in Korea. Supported by anecdotal evidence from leading members of the local SRI community, this study suggests that while we have seen the primacy and evolution of existing institutions in the SRI market, SRI growth has been buttressed by the emergence of new institutions, such as research organizations and the Korean Sustainability Investing Forum, and reinforcement by international institutions in the form of the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, global indexes and international CSR guidelines. As such, this study provides a more nuanced understanding of SRIs emergence in Korea by highlighting institutional layering and dynamics that have led to changes in the local market while eschewing the idea that the emergence of SRI was simply the result of a deliberate effort to westernize institutions. Indeed, in Koreas case, while SRI is a borrowed concept, its primary function has been to address corporate governance issues rather than to generate superior financial returns. In addition to theory-building, findings also highlight practical implications, including opportunities for more rigorous corporate social performance analysis and investment advisory, greater market coordination and awareness-building, and the need to monitor corporate social performance and financial performance going forward.", PurposeRecently, socially and responsible investments (SRI) have constantly grown becoming a highly discussed issue. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to better understand if environmental social governance (ESG) criteria integration in investment strategies can support the transition of finance toward a more sustainable growth.Design/methodology/approachAn explorative analysis based on a multiple case study has been conducted and addressed by a content analysis on the Key Investors Information Documents (KIIDs) that the sample companies published for 2020.FindingsThe achieved results demonstrated that the case companies differently integrated ESG into their SRI; thus, if some of them are quite near to a full integration, the others demonstrated less than a full commitment with ESG. This seems to be mainly due to the different approach that asset management companies (AMCs) and/or managers have adopted for integrating ESG criteria.Research limitations/implicationsEven though the achieved results offered some interesting insights for asset managers, the explorative and qualitative nature of this study and the small sample investigated somewhat limits it.Practical implicationsAMCs, consultants and managers in developing and implementing their SRI strategy could be much more focused on the importance of ESG integration for the transition toward a more responsible and sustainable finance (micro-level) as well as a more sustainable development (macro-level).Originality/valueThe paper provides new insights into the essence of SRI strategies and their potential to contribute to sustainable development. Thus, it tries to shed new lights on the role that ESG can have to stimulate and support investment decisions and, in so doing, contributing to make finance grow more sustainable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It aims to explore whether ESG-aligned funds deliver superior financial performance, particularly in terms of risk-adjusted returns and if these funds demonstrate better market timing abilities compared to their lower-rated counterparts.Design/methodology/approachThe analysis covers a 10-year period from January 2013 to December 2022, focusing on Eurozone-based mutual funds with more than 40% of their assets under management (AUM) invested in technology firms. The sample includes 912 funds, categorized by their ESG ratings (AAA to CCC), using MSCI ratings as the classification metric. The performance evaluation uses risk-adjusted measures such as the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio and Jensens alpha, along with an assessment of market timing capabilities based on an extended four-factor model.FindingsThe results show that mutual funds with higher ESG ratings consistently outperform their lower-rated peers in both absolute and risk-adjusted returns. These funds also exhibit superior market timing abilities. ESG-aligned funds not only provide a favorable risk-return profile but also enhance the appeal of responsible investment strategies, particularly within the volatile and innovation-driven technology sector. The study reinforces the notion that ESG factors contribute positively to long-term value creation for investors.Practical implicationsThe findings are valuable for investors and policymakers aiming to incorporate ESG factors into investment strategies, especially in sectors characterized by rapid technological advancements. The superior performance of ESG-compliant funds highlights the importance of sustainable investing and its potential to align financial returns with broader environmental and social goals.Originality/valueThis study adds to the growing body of literature on ESG investing by specifically focusing on tech-heavy mutual funds in the Eurozone. It offers new insights into how ESG ratings at the fund level, rather than at the firm level, influence investment performance and market timing within the high-growth, high-risk technology sector.", Using a sample of 2,516 U.S. mutual funds over the 2010-2017 period, we examine the effects of so-cially responsible investing (SRI) on mutual fund performance. We use two proxies for deviations from SRI: social active share (SAS), and social tracking error (STE). Respectively, they capture the differences in holdings and returns between a fund and a socially responsible index, the MSCI KLD 400. In univariate analyses, the SAS results align with more socially responsible funds outperforming less socially responsi-ble funds, while the STE results provide mixed evidence. In multivariate analyses, both SAS and STE show that more socially responsible funds outperform their less socially responsible peers. We also find that socially responsible funds exhibit lower risk. Taken together, our results provide evidence that SRI does not damage fund performance but can reduce fund risk.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved., "Compared to matched conventional mutual funds, socially responsible mutual funds outperform during periods of market crises. This dampening of downside risk comes at the cost of underperforming during non-crisis periods. Investors seeking downside protection would value the asymmetry of these returns. This asymmetric return pattern is driven by the mutual funds that focus on environmental, social, or governance (ESG) attributes and is especially pronounced in ESG funds that use positive screening techniques. Furthermore, the observed patterns are attributed to the funds socially responsible attributes and not the differences in fund portfolio management or the characteristics of the companies in fund portfolios.

This paper examines the rela-tionship between ESG responsibility and stock returns in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigates the impact of ESG responsibility on stock price resilience. The results indicate that corporate ESG scores have positive impacts on stock returns during and after the COVID-19 crisis, with the positive impacts of ESG being more significant in the post-crisis period. Among the different ESG dimensions, environmental responsibility (ESG_E) has a more significant impact on stock returns, while social responsibility (ESG_S) and governance responsibility (ESG_G) have mixed impacts during the crisis. Furthermore, during and after the outbreak of COVID-19, the positive impacts of ESG are more pronounced among firms located in low-trust regions and firms with lower analyst coverage. Additionally, the study finds that corporate ESG responsibility help restore the resilience of stock prices during the crisis, with better ESG performance leading to stronger stock price resilience. Overall, the results strongly support the conclusion that ESG has acted as an "equity vaccine" during the COVID-19 pandemic., "This paper assesses the association of ESG scores with stock returns and highlights the moderating role of the COVID-19 pandemic and the countrys governance. The study uses panel data regression models to assess the relationship between ESG factors and stock returns, focusing on the moderating role of country governance and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal that governance quality significantly enhances the positive effects of ESG practices on returns, particularly during times of crisis. These suggest that higher overall ESG scores are related positively to financial performance, and this relation is enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the two dimensions of ESG that matter most are environmental and governance. Country-level governance is important because firms in well-governed countries amplify the benefits of high ESG scores. The opposite is true for the higher controversies scores, whose bad financial outcome is magnified during the pandemic. These results present an argument for the resilience of firm financial performance, dependent on strong ESG practices and governance frameworks. This holds great interest for investors and policymakers in associating good ESG considerations with the effective management of financial risks, leading to sustainable returns during periods of widespread economic uncertainty.", "PurposeThis paper aims to examine the consistency between firms stakeholder-friendly responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and their environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings. Consistent firms are those with high prior ESG ratings that actively support stakeholders during the COVID-19 crisis.Design/methodology/approachThe authors use data from JUST Capital, which tracks Russell 1000 firms actions in response to the pandemic, to examine the relationship between pre-pandemic ESG ratings and their COVID responses towards employees, customers and communities. The authors also analyse the impact of firms consistency between pre-pandemic ESG ratings and stakeholder-friendly COVID responses on ESG ratings and stock returns.FindingsThis study finds that firms with higher pre-pandemic ESG ratings are more likely to support their stakeholders during the pandemic. The authors also find that firms with high ESG ratings before the pandemic experience a decline in their ESG ratings if they do not actively support their communities during the COVID-19 crisis, although insufficient employee/customer support does not impact their ESG ratings. Finally, the authors find that firms with higher pre-pandemic ESG ratings that continue to uphold their ESG commitments through community assistance during the pandemic achieve higher stock returns compared to inconsistent firms.Practical implicationsThe results reveal gaps in how comprehensively ESG agencies assess firms crisis responses, highlighting areas for rating improvements. The findings contribute to sustainable development by revealing the importance of firms upholding their ESG commitments during crises to maintain stakeholder trust and drive long-term value creation.Social implicationsThe findings underscore the need for responsive, transparent ESG rating processes to support the integration of sustainability considerations into corporate practices and investment decisions, particularly during evolving societal expectations during crises.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to investigate how pre-pandemic ESG ratings explain firms stakeholder-friendly responses during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyse the integration of these responses and pandemic risks into ESG ratings during the crisis."

This paper analyzes the risk contagion mechanisms within Chinas financial system from the perspective of volatility spillovers associated with ESG investments. Initially, the study employs the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) model to calculate the variance decomposition spillover index, contrasting the dynamics and risk transmission mechanisms of market volatility between portfolios composed of ESG and conventional stocks. Building upon the analysis of risk spillover relations among financial sub-markets, the study utilizes the generalized forecast error variance decomposition method to construct a complex network of financial system risk spillovers, investigating the risk contagion characteristics within both financial systems through network topology. Empirical findings indicate a significant reduction in the risk and net spillover effects of Chinas financial system when ESG stock indices replace conventional stock indices, with a notable mutation in the volatility spillover network structure during extreme risk events and even more substantial changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, based on volatility spillover analysis, the study computes optimal weights and hedging strategies for portfolios incorporating the ESG volatility index and other market volatility indices. The conclusions of this research are instrumental for regulatory authorities in establishing early warning mechanisms and for investors in avoiding financial investment risks.", Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the dynamic connectedness and volatility spillovers between commodities and corporations exhibiting the best environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. In addition, the authors determine the optimal hedge ratios and portfolio weights for ESG and commodity investors and portfolio managers. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the novel frequency connectedness framework to point out volatility spillover between ESG indices covering the USA, developed and emerging markets and commodity indices, including energy (crude oil, natural gas and heating oil), industrial metals (aluminum, copper, zinc, nickel and lead) and precious metals (gold and silver) by using daily data between January 3, 2011 and May 26, 2021, covering significant socio-economic developments and the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings The results of this study suggest a total connectedness index at a mediocre level, mainly driven by the shocks creating uncertainty in the short term. And the results indicate that all ESG indices are net volatility transmitters, and all commodity indices other than crude oil and copper are net volatility receivers. Practical implications The results imply statistically significant hedging and portfolio diversification opportunities to investors and portfolio managers across the asset classes, proven by the hedging effectiveness analyses. Social implications This study provides implications for policymakers focusing on the risk of contagion among the commodity and ESG markets during turbulent periods to ensure international financial stability. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature by differentiating ESG portfolios as the USA, developed and developing markets and examining dynamic connectedness and volatility spillovers between ESG portfolios and commodities with a different technique. This study also contributes by considering COVID-19 outbreak., This study examines the spillover dynamics and interconnectedness amongst sustainability indices, green bond markets, and oil price shocks. Using data from June 2013 to February 2023, this study employs spillover index methodology to analyze the transmission of shocks and volatility. The findings reveal that there is time-varying connectedness between all variables, which evidences a significant boost during times of crisis and extreme circumstances. Furthermore, the North American and US sustainability indices, along with the SP500 Environmental, Social, and Governance (SP_ESG) index, act as significant transmitters of shocks and volatility to other markets under different market conditions. Conversely, the Asia-Pacific, emerging market, and European sustainability indices, along with the green bond index, have emerged as net volatility receivers. Additionally, the study highlights the role of oil risk shocks as a transmitter of volatility under normal and bullish market statuses, while becoming a receiver in the lower quantile. These results have noteworthy implications for understanding the interdependencies and risks within financial markets and provide insights for investors, policymakers, and market participants.

While traditional portfolio optimization is carried out in a continuous fashion, as if stocks could be bought in fractional increments, practical implementations often resort to approximations, as fractional stocks are typically not tradeable. While these approximations are effective for large investment budgets, they deteriorate as budgets decrease. To alleviate this issue, a discrete Markowitz portfolio theory (DMPT) with finite budgets and integer stock weights can be formulated, but results in a non-polynomial (NP)-hard problem. Recent progress in quantum processing units (QPUs), including quantum annealers, makes solving DMPT problems feasible. Our study explores portfolio optimization on quantum annealers, establishing a mapping between continuous and discrete Markowitz portfolio theories. We find that correctly normalized discrete portfolios converge to continuous solutions as budgets increase. Our DMPT implementation provides efficient frontier solutions, outperforming traditional rounding methods, even for moderate budgets. Responding to the demand for environmentally and socially responsible investments, we enhance our discrete portfolio optimization with ESG (environmental, social, governance) ratings for EURO STOXX 50 index stocks. We introduce a utility function incorporating ESG ratings to balance risk, return and ESG friendliness, and discuss implications for ESG-aware investors., In this study, we address the topic of sustainable and responsible portfolio investments (SRI). The selection of such portfolios is based, in addition to traditional financial variables, on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. The interest of our approach resides in allowing socially responsible (SR) portfolio investors to select their optimal portfolios by considering their individual preferences for each objective and simultaneous definition of the degrees of acceptance and rejection. In particular, we consider socially responsible portfolio selection as an optimization problem with multiple objectives before applying interactive intuitionistic fuzzy method to solve the portfolio optimization. The robustness of our approach is tested through an empirical study on the top 10 Stocks for ESG values worldwide., Portfolio selection is one of the main financial topics. The original portfolio selection problem dealt with the trade-off between return and risk, measured as the mean returns and the variance, respectively. For investors more variables other than return and risk are considered to select the stocks to be included in the portfolio. Nowadays, many investors include corporate social responsibility as one eligibility criterion. Additionally, other return and risk measures are being employed. All of this, together with further constraints such as portfolio cardinality, which mirror real-world demands by investors, have made the multicriteria portfolio selection problem to be NP-hard. To solve this problem, heuristics such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II have been developed. The aim of this paper is to analyse the trade-off between return, risk and corporate social responsibility. To this end, we construct pareto efficient portfolios using a fuzzy multicriteria portfolio selection model with real-world constraints. The model is applied on a set of 28 stocks which are constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. The analysis shows that portfolios scoring higher in corporate social responsibility obtain lower returns. As of the risk, the riskier portfolios are those with extreme (high or low) corporate social responsibility scores. Finally, applying the proposed portfolio selection methodology, it is possible to build investment portfolios that dominate the benchmark. That is, socially responsible portfolios, measured by ESG scores, must not necessarily be penalized in terms of return or risk.

Design/methodology/approach - The author presents a sample consisting of data corresponding to 573 pension plans in relation to such aspects as financial performance, inception date, asset size, number of participants, custodial and management fees, and whether their managers adopt ethical screening or give part of their profits to social projects. On this data the author implements the fixed effects panel data model proposed by Vogelsang (2012). Findings - The results obtained indicate that investors/consumers prefer traditional or solidarity pension plans to ethical pension plans. Furthermore, the findings show that ethical investors/consumers are more (less) sensitive to positive (negative) lagged returns than caring and traditional consumers, causing traditional consumers to contribute to pension plans that they already own. Research limitations/implications - The author does not know what types of environmental, social and corporate governance criteria have been adopted by ethical pension plan managers and the weight given to each of these criteria for selecting the stock of the firms in their portfolios that could influence in the investors behaviour. Practical implications - The results obtained in the current paper show that investors invest less money in ethical pension plans than in traditional and solidarity pension plans; this could be due to the lack of information for their part. To solve this, management companies could increase the transparency about their corporate social responsibility (CSR) investments to encourage investors to invest in ethical products so these lead to raising CSR standards in companies, and therefore, sustainable development. Social implications - The Spanish socially responsible investment retail market is still at an early phase of development, and regulators should promote it in order to encourage firms to adopt business activities that take into account societal concerns. Originality/value - This paper provides new evidence in a field little analysed. This paper contributes to the existing literature by focusing on examining the behaviour of pension funds investors whose investment time horizon is in the long-term while previous literature focus on analysing behaviour of mutual fund investors whose investment time horizon is in the short/medium term what could cause different investors behaviour.", "Assets under management involved in socially responsible investing almost trebled from 2007 to 2011 in Europe, led by pension funds. Such growth has encouraged the implementation of socially responsible activities by companies, which have improved their cleaner production methods in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, total water used, energy consumption and waste generated, among others. Integrating environmental, social and governance policies for cleaner production into the investment strategy of pension plans could increase their cost deriving from the screening process and/or increase the benefits, because socially responsible companies in which pension funds invest might achieve a better financial performance than traditional companies, which could in turn affect pension plans financial performance. For this reason, the aim of this paper is two-fold: firstly, to examine the financial performance of Spanish pension plans compared to market benchmarks taking into account the category to which they belong, and the socially responsible business strategy implemented by the manager; and secondly, to analyze whether differences in financial performance exist between solidarity pension plans, ethical pension plans and traditional pension plans. To do this, we have a sample of 651 individual system pension plans. Using these sample data, we implement the robust random effects panel data methodology. The results show that ethical pension plans, which invest in companies that improve their cleaner production methods, achieve a similar financial performance to conventional pension plans, while solidarity pension plans significantly outperform conventional pension plans.

A strict orientation to environmental, social, and good governance (ESG) in the investment portfolio of pension funds can play a key role in triggering the economy toward a sustainable transition. Can responsible pension plans be an attractive investment opportunity for young people? Since the performance of pension funds depends on the demographic characteristics of investors, other than the financial results of investment portfolios, this study aimed to test the convenience of ESG-oriented pension plans for young contributors aged 20-29 with different risk propensities and attitudes towards sustainability. The analysis was started using accurate data provided by an Italian pension fund, observed from 2012 to 2022. The methods applied were a Monte Carlo simulation of the individual actuarial balances, the expected utility, and the willingness to pay. The results show that ESG-oriented pension funds are convenient for young people who invest in riskier lines. Still, it is sufficient for a light green preference to persuade young contributors to invest in ESG-oriented funds and balanced lines. The results of the study can support pension fund managers in defining and offering appropriate ESG lines suitable for younger investors."

Using data on 266 Canadian companies over the 2007-2017 period, we find a significantly positive association between corporate sustainability performance and firm financial performance. In addition, we find that companies that perform consistently well on sustainability (i.e., consistent performers) achieve better financial performance compared to inconsistent performers. Thus, far from their being net costs/expenses, our results indicate that corporate sustainability performance and consistency in sustainability performance both provide net benefits and significantly impact financial performance positively, implying that corporate sustainability not only helps address the needs of the current and future generations but also has a positive effect on the corporate bottom line. Taken together, our results suggest that not only does corporate sustainability have a positive effect on firm performance, but better financial performance may be achieved through a committed-rather than a "tokenism"-approach to corporate sustainability., The "business as usual" model is no longer possible. Globalization, technological and demographical changes have lead to the change in the internal organization structures, processes and behaviour. Environmental, social and governance issues are becoming extremely powerful means of gaining competitive advantage on the global market. The purpose of the paper is to underline the importance of socially responsible business practices for the corporation. In order to emphasize the importance of socially responsible behaviour with regards to financial performance, the research was enriched with of the comparative analysis of the financial performances of 45 corporations listed on Dow Jones Sustainability World Index 2009/2010 that represent the top 10% of the leading sustainability companies out of the biggest 2500 companies in the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index compared with non CSR corporations not listed on DJSWI. Authors are presenting results of the econometric model which further confirmed that CSR firms in the average enjoy better financial performance that non-CSR firms., The "business as usual" model is no longer possible.

By examining Bitcoins interconnectedness with environmental, social and governance (ESG) equities, this study aims to construct a socially responsible investment strategy for cypto investors.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses wavelet analysis and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model to uncover the interdependence between ESG equities and Bitcoin. This study computes the optimal ratio, showing that Bitcoin significantly reduces portfolio risk when combined with green stocks.FindingsThe results show that co-movements between green stocks and Bitcoin are low, indicating that they are suitable combinations for portfolio diversification. From an environmental perspective, this investment strategy offers a theoretical solution to mitigate the negative impacts associated with Bitcoin mining. It aims to address the dilemma faced by sustainability-conscious investors, who must navigate the economic payoff of Bitcoin against their commitment to green investment principles.Practical implicationsThe findings can provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to develop strategies that promote sustainable investments among crypto investors.Originality/valueResearch on ethical investment practices in the cryptocurrency market remains in the early stages of development. Ethical investors can benefit from including Bitcoin in their ESG equity portfolios.", Are green investments decoupled from the dirty investment such as the fossil fuel markets? We address this issue by extending the literature on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) assets by examining the dynamic relationship between fossil fuels and digital ESG assets proxied by green cryptocurrencies using the TVP-VAR(Time-varying parameter vector auto regression) spillover framework. Furthermore, we analyze the hedging attributes of green cryptocurrencies and fossil fuels in a minimum connectedness framework. The main findings are as follows: First, green cryptocurrencies are the main shock transmitters in all asset systems. Second, the dynamic connectedness between green cryptocurrencies and fossil fuels increased during the COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. Third, green cryptocurrencies have shown considerable hedging effectiveness against the fossil fuels. Our study has important implications for investors, regulators, and policy makers, such as shifting to green cryptocurrencies, regulation of carbon footprint, and promoting eco-friendly assets., The shift towards cleaner fuels from hydrocarbons has influenced nearly all market types and asset classes, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. The complex mechanism of blockchain and mining consumes high levels of electricity and surges environmental footprints in electronic waste generation. Existing studies that examine green and sustainable investments are limited to sustainable equities or green bonds; therefore, this study opens up a new research direction by considering green (energy-efficient) cryptocurrencies. First, this study develops a four-step screening process to systematically select cryptocurrencies that are greener than others. A comprehensive set of green and non-green assets and a battery of empirical tests are then employed to examine the diversification benefits of selected green cryptocurrencies against several well-diversified equity portfolios at the global, regional, and country levels. The diversification benefits of green cryptocurrencies are compared with non-green cryptocurrencies using (i) the four-moment modified value at risk and conditional value at risk, (ii) four different portfolio optimization strategies, and (iii) dynamic correlation-based hedge and safe-haven regression analyses. The results show that green cryptocurrencies provide diversification benefits that are at least comparable to, and in some cases, superior to, non-green (energy-intensive) cryptocurrencies. Cardano and Tezos are identified as green cryptocurrencies offering the most diversification benefits to investors, followed by EOS, Steller, and IOTA. This study provides valuable insights to investors and policymakers, specifically those concerned with achieving sustainability and ESG-compliance (environmental-social-governance) goals and seeking green assets to hedge and diversify various traditional investments.

This study explores whether and how environment, social, and governance (ESG) ratings influence corporate green innovation by using an independent thirdparty rating agencys (SynTao Green Finance) ESG ratings in China as a quasi-natural experiment. We find companies covered by the ESG rating agency significantly increase green innovation output by 3.9%, mainly as an increase in green invention patents. ESG ratings positive effects on green innovation are more pronounced for firms whose investors are less short-sighted, non-state-owned enterprises and firms with higher degree of financial constraints. Additionally, we find ESG ratings impact can also increase the green innovation quality and synergetic green innovation. Thus, ESG ratings from third-party institutions can effectively increase corporate green innovation, which has important implications for companies to achieve green transformation and for emerging markets to improve ESG rating systems.", With the establishment of China\s "dual carbon" target and the promotion of high-quality development strategy, the role of green innovation has become increasingly important. Corporate ESG innovation, as a guiding principle for companies to practice sustainable development and an important signal for evaluating their environmental and social responsibilities as well as corporate governance level, deserves in-depth research on its impact on green innovation performance. This paper empirically analyzes the green innovation effect of corporate ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) performance using Chinese A-share listed companies as a sample from 2009 to 2021. The research shows that corporate ESG performance can enhance green innovation performance. Mechanism analysis reveals that ESG performance mainly improves green innovation performance by alleviating financing constraints and enhancing human capital. Further research shows that all three sub-dimensions of ESG performance contribute to improving green innovation performance, with the strongest effect observed in corporate governance performance. ESG performance not only enhances strategic green innovation performance and independent green innovation performance but also improves substantial green innovation performance and collaborative green innovation performance. Therefore, the government should improve the ESG information disclosure system, increase support for companies with excellent ESG performance, and improve local talent policies to attract high-quality green innovation talents. Investors should incorporate ESG performance into their decision-making and strengthen the identification and use of ESG information. Companies should formulate ESG strategies, increase relevant investments, prioritize corporate governance improvement, and enhance the quality of ESG information disclosure through various means., "PurposeThe transition to green growth goals requires the concerted efforts of the whole society. Enterprises, as important players in the market, play a key role in promoting green and sustainable development. The rise of the concept of sustainable development has enabled more enterprises to disclose environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, and ESG behaviour is regarded as a positive strategic behaviour to implement the new development concept. This paper aims to explore the influence of ESG performance on enterprise green innovation.Design/methodology/approachThis study applies a fixed effect model and the regulation effect of empirical analysis to explore the influence of ESG performance on enterprise green innovation. The object of investigation is 2014-2021 Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies.FindingsThe results of an empirical analysis outline the following conclusions: (1) ESG performance has a significant effect on enterprise green innovation, mainly by easing the pressure of the financing enterprise, fitting stakeholders environmental protection concept and obtaining employee organizational identity that influences enterprise green innovation. (2) Government regulation positively regulates the role of ESG performance in promoting the green innovation of enterprises. (3) Heterogeneity analysis found that the strengthening role of ESG performance on the green innovation of enterprises is stronger in green invention patents, state-owned enterprises and nonheavily polluting industries.Research limitations/implicationsDespite the valuable findings, this study has a few limitations. Thus, it is necessary to extend the object of investigation by adding other Asian countries, which allows for comparison analysis and allocating best practices for promoting green innovation. Besides, innovation and ESG performance depend on the quality of institutions. In this case, the future study should incorporate the indicators that reveal the quality of institutions (corruption, transparency, digitalisation, voice, accountability, etc.).Practical implicationsAccording to the above conclusions, this paper proposes suggestions at the level of enterprises, government and investors. At the enterprise level, ESG responsibility should be strengthened, ESG information should be consciously disclosed and the quality of ESG disclosure should be improved. Government departments should play the role of supervisors, improve the construction of ESG information disclosure systems and promote the formation of ESG systems. At the social level, investors should improve the ESG information status and pay more attention to the ESG performance of enterprises.Originality/valueThis study fills the scientific gaps in the analysis impact of ESG performance on the green innovation of enterprises. This paper contributes to the theoretical landscape of ESG efficiency by developing approaches based on two empirical models: testing the impact of enterprise ESG performance on green innovation and testing whether government regulation plays a regulatory role in the relationship between ESG performance and green innovation. Besides, this study analysed the ESG performance and green innovation within the following categories: heavy and nonheavy polluter industries; state and nonstate-owned enterprise groups."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Based on the perspective of resources and capabilities, this article uses the relevant data of 1588 listed companies in strategic emerging industries from 2011 to 2021 to study the impact of digital transformation on enterprise ESG performance examines the intermediary role of absorptive capacity and the moderating role of regional digitalization level, and further analyzes the heterogeneity of property rights and industrial nature. The research results indicate that: firstly, digital transformation of enterprises can positively promote the improvement of ESG performance; secondly, absorptive capacity serves as a conduit through which digital transformation influences a companys ESG performance; thirdly, the regional digitalization level positively moderates the promotion effect of digital transformation on enterprise ESG performance; fourthly, the impact of digital transformation on ESG performance of enterprises is significantly differentiated in the nature of enterprise property rights and industrial nature, and the ESG performance of state-owned enterprises and high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises is more sensitive to digital transformation. The research conclusion is based on a digital perspective, providing relevant insights for improving the ESG performance of strategic emerging industry enterprises and expanding their ESG development paths.", "PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether the corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of enterprise is influenced by the enterprise digital transformation. In addition, this study explains how enterprise digital transformation affects ESG performance.Design/methodology/approachThe sample covers 4,646 nonfinancial companies listed on Chinas A-share market from 2009 to 2021. The study adopts the fixed-effects multiple linear regression to perform the data analysis.FindingsThe study finds that enterprise digital transformation has a significant inverted U-shaped impact on ESG performance. Moderate digital transformation can improve enterprise ESG performance, whereas excessive digital transformation will bring new organizational conflicts and increase enterprise costs, which is detrimental to ESG performance. This inverted U-shaped effect is more pronounced in industrial cities, manufacturing industries and enterprises with less financing constraints and executives with financial backgrounds. Enterprise digital transformation mainly affects ESG performance by affecting the level of internal information communication and disclosure, the level of internal control and the principal-agent cost.Practical implicationsThe government should take multiple measures to encourage enterprises to choose appropriate digital transformation based on their own production behaviors and development strategies, encourage them to innovate and upgrade their organizational management and development models in conjunction with digital transformation and guide them to use digital technology to improve ESG performance.Social implicationsThis study shows that irrational digital transformation cannot effectively improve the ESG performance of enterprises and promote the sustainable development of the country. Enterprises should carry out reasonable digital transformation according to their own development needs and finally improve the green and sustainable development ability of enterprises and promote the sustainable development of society.Originality/valueThis study examines the relationship between enterprise digital transformation and ESG performance. Different from the linear relationship between the two in previous major studies, this study proves the inverse U-shaped relationship between enterprise digital transformation and ESG performance through mathematical theoretical model derivation and empirical test. This study also explores in detail how corporate digital transformation affects ESG performance, as well as discusses heterogeneity at the city, industry and firm levels. It is proposed that enterprises should take into account their own characteristics and carry out reasonable digital transformation according to their development needs.", "Companys digital transformation and Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance are crucial for their development, but there is little literature that considers whether and how digital transformation improve ESG performance, the impact of environmental regulations is also easily overlooked, we attempt to fill this gap. Based on data related to Chinese listed enterprises from 2011 to 2020, we focus on the internal digital transformation of enterprises, analyze and empirically test the direct and mediating influence of digital transformation on enterprises ESG performance, as well as the moderating effect of external environmental regulations. The results show that digital transformation improves ESG performance. Heterogeneity analysis found that digital transformation had different impacts on different dimensions of enterprise ESG performance. Further analysis indicates that enterprises green innovation and labor demand play a mediating role in the relationship between enterprises digital transformation and ESG performance. Regional formal environmental regulation and informal environmental regulation moderates the path of firms digital transformation promoting green innovation level to enhance ESG performance. This paper provides micro evidence in China for exploring the improvement of enterprises ESG performance and provides relevant ideas for understanding the effect of digital transformation."

ESG represents important indicators for measuring the green management concept of enterprises and promoting high-quality economic development and sustainable development ability. To discuss the relationship between ESG, financing constraints and enterprise value, based on resource dependence and financing constraint theory, using the data of new energy enterprises in A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2017 to 2021 in China, the effect of ESG on enterprise value, and the moderating role of financing constraints in the impact relationship were analyzed. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of regional location, enterprise ownership, and pollution degree were discussed. Results show that, good ESG performance can significantly improve the value of new energy enterprises. However, financing constraints hinder the value of these enterprises, and financing constraints inhibit the positive role of ESG performance in promoting enterprise value to a certain extent. ESG performance is prominent in new energy enterprises in the eastern and southern regions, among state-owned enterprises, and firms with heavy pollution. Conclusions provide empirical evidence for the development of enterprises through ESG performance, and have certain reference significance for the government, investors, and enterprises, allowing them to attach importance to ESG performance, strengthen and improve financing, and promote the development of enterprises., "This study uses a two-way fixed-effect model to analyze the impact of ESG performance on corporate value based on the quarterly data of Chinese A-share listed sports companies from 2018 to 2022. The results prove that (1) The ESG performance of sports enterprises positively affects corporate value: the higher the ESG score is, the higher the corporate value is. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that financing constraints play a partially mediating role in the relationship between ESG performance and corporate value. (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that corporate political relations will weaken the facilitating effect of ESG performance on corporate value. The stronger the political relations are, the weaker the facilitating effect of ESG performance on corporate value. Compared with that during the bear market, the performance of ESG in the bull market has a greater facilitating effect on corporate value. Compared with sports service enterprises, sports goods enterprises ESG performance has a stronger facilitating effect on corporate value. Research question: This paper provide an in-depth discussion of the impact of sports enterprises ESG (environment, social responsibility and corporate governance) performance on corporate value. Research methods: This study uses a two-way fixed-effect model to analyze the impact of ESG performance on corporate value based on the quarterly data of Chinese A-share listed sports companies from 2018 to 2022. Results and findings: The results prove that (1) The ESG performance of sports enterprises positively affects corporate value: the higher the ESG score is, the higher the corporate value is. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that financing constraints play a partially mediating role in the relationship between ESG performance and corporate value. (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that corporate political relations will weaken the facilitating effect of ESG performance on corporate value. The stronger the political relations are, the weaker the facilitating effect of ESG performance on corporate value. Compared with that during the bear market, the performance of ESG in the bull market has a greater facilitating effect on corporate value. Compared with sports service enterprises, sports goods enterprises ESG performance has a stronger facilitating effect on corporate value. Implications: It is helpful for relevant enterprises to clarify the positive influence of ESG performance on corporate value to stimulate the internal motivation of sports enterprises to fulfil their ESG responsibilities while boosting the sustainable development of sports enterprises and the green and coordinated development of the sports industry. Limitations: The overall data is relatively less, and the research methods need to be enriched.", "With the deepening of the concept of sustainable development, the academic community has paid more and more attention to how enterprises can achieve value co-creation for multiple stakeholders from the perspective of corporate innovation. ESG is a new concept concerned with how to achieve sustainable development in enterprises in terms of environment, society, and corporate governance. However, there is still a lack of research on how to reshape the innovation processes of enterprises based on the new concept of sustainability and bring competitive value to corporate value. Based on this, we took the listed companies on the main board of the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares from 2010 to 2020 as the research object and empirically tested the impact effect of corporate ESG on corporate value, as well as the mediating effect of corporate innovation between corporate ESG and corporate value. At the same time, the institutional environment was incorporated as a moderating variable to further explore its influence mechanism. Finally, the heterogeneity of corporate ESG on corporate value was analyzed at both an enterprise level and a regional level. The results show that corporate ESG and its three sub-dimensions can significantly improve corporate value and innovation level; the internal mechanism shows that corporate innovation plays a mediating role between corporate ESG and its three sub-dimensions, while institutional environment play a moderating effect; non-state-owned enterprises ESG has a higher impact on corporate value than state-owned enterprises, especially in eastern China, where the value enhancement effect of ESG is more significant."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This paper selects the listed enterprises in Chinas Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares from 2011 to 2020 as the research sample, and uses the difference-in-differences model to examine the impact mechanism of CET pilot policy on corporate sustainability. The findings show that: (1) The CET pilot policy can improve the corporate sustainability, but the value transformation effect is not sustainable. (2) Green investment, green innovation and green finance can act as mediating paths, and the first two have a masking effect on policy effects. (3) For private enterprises, small-scale enterprises and enterprises in regions with high carbon emission, CET pilot policy has a more prominent effect on improving corporate sustainability. This paper complements the existing literature on assessing policy effectiveness and optimizing policy systems. In addition, it provides empirical evidence to respond positively to the CET for enterprises.", "Improving the incentive mechanism and institutional framework of green finance policy is important to promote the synchronization of environmental management and enterprise development. Based on Chinas green finance reform and innovation pilot (GFRIP) policy in 2017, this study constructs a quasi-natural experiment with a sample of A-share listed companies and draws the following conclusions. (1) The effectiveness of GFRIP policy in significantly promoting enterprises ESG performance in pilot areas, robustness tests such as propensity score matching and placebo tests reconfirm conclusions. (2) The GFRIP policy can effectively improve enterprise ESG performance by easing financing constraints, promoting green investment, and improving managers green cognition. (3) Both external environmental law enforcement and internal manager environmental awareness can enhance the promotion effect of the GFRIP policy on ESG performance. (4) Heterogeneity analysis shows that the ESG performance of state-owned enterprises, large enterprises, and high-polluting enterprises is more affected by pilot policy. The results of the study provide a valuable perspective on how the government can promote green finance policies and implications for enterprises sustainable development.", The green finance policy is crucial for enterprises to participate in environmental governance actively. Taking the "Green Credit Guidelines" issued by China in 2012 as a quasi-natural experiment, this study investigated the impact of green finance policies on corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance by using a continuous Difference-in-Differences (DID) model based on the data of listed companies from 2006 to 2020. The conclusions are: (1) The green finance policy significantly improves corporate ESG, but the effects vary across enterprises. (2) The policy has encouraged enterprises to develop and adopt green products and technologies. Still, it has not had a positive effect on the treatment of enterprise pollutant emissions because the implementation of the policy makes enterprises pay more attention to front-end risk control than pollution treatment after production. (3) Research results have heterogeneity. The impact of green finance policies on enterprises at different levels of environmental regulation is different. Enterprises in areas with high intensity of environmental regulation are more vulnerable to green credit. The conclusion of this paper helps improve the green finance policy system, enhance the awareness and level of corporate ESG, and strengthen the collaborative governance of policies and enterprises on environmental issues in combination with the mandatory environmental regulations and incentive mechanisms to promote the green development of enterprises and realize the goal of carbon neutrality.

This study explores the prevalence of greenwashing, its forms, impacts, and potential remedies. It underscores the need to align investor values with genuine environmental sustainability, emphasizing the pitfalls of greenwashing in sustainable finance. Methods: The study employs a scoping review methodology guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework. It involves systematically searching, selecting, and synthesizing evidence from various databases and sources to map critical concepts, types of evidence, and research gaps in greenwashing within sustainable finance. Results: The study reveals diverse greenwashing strategies across industries, including ambiguous language, irrelevant claims, and opacity. It highlights greenwashings severe consequences on corporate reputation, financial performance, and stakeholder trust. The effectiveness of regulatory bodies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and certifications in curbing greenwashing is discussed, though their effectiveness is debatable. The research also examines greenwashings impact on investor behavior and decision-making. Discussion: This research contributes to understanding greenwashing in sustainable finance, emphasizing vigilance, transparency, and accountability. It calls for more stringent regulations, international cooperation, and public awareness to combat greenwashing effectively. The study also suggests that businesses should adopt genuine and transparent environmental practices to avoid the risks of greenwashing, including legal repercussions. For future research, the study proposes a deeper exploration of the mechanisms enabling greenwashing and the effectiveness of different regulatory strategies and measures to combat it.", Corporate social responsibility is the balance between a firm\s economic outcomes and environmental protection. However, investors face increasing difficulties in selecting assets with suitable environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies because companies may "greenwash" their activities by, for example, make misleading ESG disclosures. Here, we investigate the determinants that lead to companies engaging in ESG greenwashing. By analyzing international large-cap companies across 47 countries and territories, we create a peer-relative greenwashing score to measure the magnitude of ESG greenwashing by companies. First, we measure and evaluate the greenwashing by analyzing ESG disclosures and creating peer-relative performance scores that consider the level of disclosure and the real ESG performance. Second, we show that companies\ greenwashing decisions are motivated by financial constraints and thus the financial environment is a determinant of greenwashing behavior. Third, we describe how intermediation can alleviate financial constraints and decrease greenwashing behavior. Moreover, highly leveraged companies may have increased financial pressure and thus may enhance their greenwashing behavior. Our findings are robust according to several different measurements of financial constraint indicators., The greenwashing phenomenon, which implies the misalignment between environmental disclosure and performance, has received significant scholarly attention. We review the diverse literature on corporate greenwashing to develop an integrative framework that examines its antecedents and consequences from the perspective of corporate governance. Specifically, we identify theoretical perspectives commonly assumed in the literature on greenwashing, including green marketing, green finance, signaling strategy, and corporate decoupling. We outline why and how greenwashing occurs from the aspects of external governance environments and internal governance mechanisms, and what influences greenwashing exerts on firm performance and stakeholder reactions. The analysis further leads to the identification of a research agenda to continue advancing our understanding of corporate greenwashing. Future studies should re-evaluate whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues should be included in greenwashing, address potential trade-offs within an ESG framework, explore internal governance mechanisms that influence greenwashing, and examine the differentiated impacts of corporate greenwashing on various stakeholders.

Using manually collected data of CEOs foreign experience and corporate ESG data from the Bloomberg database for Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2020, we observe that CEOs with foreign imprinting tend to improve their corporate ESG performance in China. The positive relationship between CEO foreign experience and corporate ESG performance is more significant when the CEO is female, when the CEO is more educated, and when the firm is state-owned. To better understand the underlying influence, our study indicates that the influence of CEOs foreign experiences on corporate ESG performance is primarily manifested in the advancement of corporate social and environmental responsibility. Section 4.3 reveals that experiences obtained from developed economies have a more pronounced impact on promoting firms ESG performance compared to experiences gained in underdeveloped countries. This empirical evidence underscores the significance of foreign experiences gained in developed economies in driving firms ESG performance. Overall, our research makes a contribution to the study of CEOs foreign exposure and corporate ESG performance.", "This paper focuses on Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) with green experience, using data from listed companies in Chinas heavy pollution industry spanning from 2011 to 2021, the study explores the impact of CEO green experience on the Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) performance of companies. The study reveals that CEO green experiences contribute to enhancing firms ESG performance. The research further unveils that managements green perceptions and corporate green innovations play a partial mediating role in the relationship between CEO green experiences and corporate ESG performance. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the influence of CEO green experiences on corporate ESG performance is more pronounced in samples characterized by high environmental regulation, capital-intensive operations, and non-state ownership. The findings of this study enrich the theory of corporate ESG performance power mechanisms and provide theoretical references for enhancing the ESG performance of heavily polluting firms.", "Practicing ESG concepts is considered a viable way to achieve sustainable development for enterprises and is an important contributor to realizing high-quality economic development. This paper builds on the upper echelons theory, which posits that a companys strategic decisions are influenced by the cognitive perceptions and values of its CEO. Based on the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021, this paper empirically examines the impact of CEOs green, academic, and political experiences on corporate ESG performance through multiple regression analysis. This study found that CEO experience has a significant impact on corporate ESG performance: rich green, academic, and political experience promotes corporate ESG performance. A stepwise regression test found that CEO experience drives corporate ESG performance by improving corporate green innovation and alleviating financing constraints. Further analysis showed that the contribution of CEO experience to ESG performance is more pronounced for firms with younger CEOs, non-state-owned enterprises, and high-polluting industries, although CEO gender is insignificant. The findings of this study provide important policy implications to improve ESG responsibility."

It is important to integrate ESG considerations into labor investment decisions. We examine the impact of ESG performance on firms labor investment efficiency. Using data from A-share listed firms from 2015 to 2020, we find that ESG performance improves labor investment efficiency. Such positive effect is robust after using alternative measures for labor investment efficiency and ESG performance, alternative regression specifications, and a bunch of endogeneity tests. The mechanism tests show that a strong ESG record can reduce financial constraints and improve the information environment, thus subsequently boosting the efficiency of labor investment. The findings of the study shed light on efficiency improvement in labor investment for management, regulatory authority, and environmental activists.", Dramatic changes in the business environment have created demands for additional information such as management discussions, governance information, and financial statement notes that go beyond the coverage of traditional financial reporting. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information can help gain stakeholder trust, reduce transaction costs, and improve investment efficiency. Taking Chinese A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2020 as a sample, we run fixed effect regressions to test the effect of ESG performance on investment efficiency. ESG performance is measured with the ESG score from the Bloomberg database. The results show that (a) good ESG performance significantly improves investment efficiency, (b) auditing quality partially mediates the relationship between ESG performance and investment efficiency, and (c) the role of ESG performance is stronger in non-state-owned enterprises, undeveloped regions, and firms with low accounting information quality. This paper contributes to the literature on ESG performance and provides references for ESG practice and sustainable corporate development in emerging countries., "Purpose This study aims to examine the impacts of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure and financial reporting quality (FRQ) on investment efficiency. Design/methodology/approach Several econometric models have been applied to estimate the impacts of ESG disclosure and FRQ on investment efficiency, using the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a sample in 2010-2019. Estimations considered subsamples of underinvestment, overinvestment and low and high FRQ values. Findings Empirical results show a positive relationship between ESG disclosure, FRQ and investment efficiency, and that this relationship is more important in the underinvestment and high FRQ sub-samples. Results suggest that ESG disclosure improves transparency, mitigates information asymmetry and enhances investment efficiency. Research limitations/implications The findings could help UAE regulators incorporate ESG information into reporting and implement effective mechanisms to increase the extent of ESG information to improve investment efficiency. This study only examined UAE traded companies. Future research should investigate other factors influencing investment efficiency and conduct comparative studies across Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Social implications This study reveals the significant positive impact of ESG disclosure and FRQ on investment efficiency. These findings will help companies optimize their ESG information disclosure, improve the quality of their financial reports and comply with ESG standards. The study aims to develop knowledge that will not only benefit companies regarding the potential impact of ESG disclosure but also help national and international society create a better social environment and reduce climate change. Originality/value To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to examine the relationship between ESG disclosure, FRQ and corporate investment efficiency. The research contributes to understanding the financial impacts of ESG disclosure and FRQ and supports regulators efforts to enforce ESG disclosure and improve FRQ."

Governments in various countries have introduced many tax incentives to motivate companies to actively fulfill their ESG responsibilities. However, no research has been conducted in academia to study the relationship between tax incentives and ESG performance. This study aims to fill the gap in this area and investigate whether tax incentives can effectively motivate the improvement of corporate ESG performance. Using a two-way fixed effects model, this paper empirically investigates the relationship between tax incentives and corporate ESG performance and the paths of action, using Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2020 as the research sample, and finds that (1) tax incentives significantly contribute to the enhancement of corporate ESG performance; (2) financing constraints play a partly mediating role in the relationship between tax incentives and corporate ESG performance; (3) a favorable business environment can enhance the promotional effect of tax incentives on corporate ESG performance; (4) the incentive effect of tax incentives on corporate ESG performance is more significant among state-owned enterprises, enterprises in the eastern region, larger enterprises, enterprises with more concentrated equity, and enterprises with better quality of internal control. The research in this paper enriches the research perspective on the factors influencing corporate ESG performance and provides strong empirical evidence to support the implementation and improvement of ESG-related tax incentives, helping the implementation of the concept of sustainable development and high-quality economic development., "Can the greening of the tax system truly drive high-quality development of enterprises? ESG, as an investment concept and evaluation criterion focusing on corporate sustainable development, is an essential tool for enterprises to practice high-quality economic development. Based on this, using Chinas environmental protection tax reform in 2018 as a natural experiment, this paper examines the impact and transmission paths of environmental protection tax on enterprises ESG performance from the unique dual perspectives of external attention and internal decision-making, adopting a diference-in-differences (DID) approach. The study finds that, firstly, environmental protection tax significantly improves enterprises ESG levels through the internal level of green innovation and external public environmental concerns. Moreover, the level of internal governance and external analyst attention play a positive moderating role in this process. Secondly, the improvement effect of environmental protection tax on enterprises ESG performance is more significant for manufacturing enterprises, non-state-owned enterprises, financially resource-rich enterprises, and enterprises located in regions with higher economic growth, lower government-market linkage, and better legal environment. This research responds to the fundamental question of whether the greening of the tax system can truly promote high-quality development of enterprises, and provides valuable insight into how to further enhance the promoting role of environmental protection tax on enterprises ESG performance.", This article selects 2992 Chinese heavily polluting listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2014 to 2022 as research samples and conducts a natural experiment based on the implementation of the Environmental Protection Tax Law in 2018. The empirical study investigates the impact of the implementation of the Environmental Protection Tax Law on green innovation in heavily polluting enterprises using the difference-in-differences method. The research finds that the levy of environmental protection tax is beneficial for improving the level of corporate ESG performance, thereby enhancing the green innovation capability of heavily polluting enterprises. At the same time, the promotion of green innovation levels in heavily polluting enterprises by the Environmental Protection Tax Law mainly depends on strategic green innovation rather than substantive green innovation. Moreover, the impact of environmental protection tax on enterprises of different natures and scales varies significantly. Environmental protection taxes have notably enhanced green innovation levels more in state-owned enterprises than their non-state-owned counterparts. Similarly, large-scale enterprises have seen a more substantial increase in green innovation due to environmental protection taxes than smaller enterprises. In addition, corporate ESG performance plays a mediating role in the impact of environmental protection taxes on green innovation in heavily polluting enterprises. From the dual perspectives of environmental protection taxes and corporate ESG performance, this paper proposes ideas for the improvement of green innovation levels in heavily polluting enterprises. At the same time, it provides empirical evidence for the economic consequences of environmental protection taxes and corporate ESG performance and suggests that enterprises improve their green innovation system and enhance the quality of ESG information disclosure. The government is improving the system of environmental taxation and ESG information disclosure, enhancing public awareness of environmental protection, and exercising supervision over energy supply.

Could robust ESG performance become a new advantage for supporting companies outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in emerging markets? Prior studies have not articulated the nexus between ESG performance and OFDI. This paper aims to conduct both theoretical and empirical work to clarify the effect, especially the mechanisms of ESG performance on companies OFDI.Design/methodology/approachUsing the data of A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2020, this paper empirically tests the effect and the mechanisms of ESG performance on companies OFDI.FindingsFirstly, robust ESG performance increases the likelihood of companies engaging in OFDI and also augments the scale of such investments. Within the realm of ESG, environmental performance, social performance and governance performance all play important roles in fostering OFDI. Secondly, strong ESG performance promotes OFDI by enhancing the competitive edge and alleviating financial constraints. Also, environmental performance, social performance and governance performance individually contribute to supporting competitiveness and mitigating financial constraints. Thirdly, the effect of ESG performance on OFDI is particularly pronounced for companies targeting developed countries, those operating in heavily polluting sectors and those with significant institutional investor presence.Originality/valueThis study advances the applicability of the stakeholder theory in the realm of firm internationalization. Moreover, the findings of this paper provide new strategies for promoting the OFDI of companies in emerging market economies.", "People are increasingly aware of the extent to which enterprises either improve or harm social welfare, with a growing trend to use environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators to evaluate and describe efforts in this area. However, most research has neglected multinational enterprises, especially the significant impact of the radical and leapfrogging internationalisation of emerging market multinational enterprises (EMNEs) on sustainable development. This study discusses ESG in the context of the research and development (R&D) internationalisation of EMNEs and uses microdata from Chinese listed manufacturing enterprises from 2010 to 2020. Employing a propensity score matching (PSM) method and difference-in-differences (DID) estimation, this study empirically tests the effect of R&D internationalisation on the ESG performance of Chinese enterprises and their boundary conditions. This study finds that R&D internationalisation positively impacts enterprises ESG performance through two pathways: improving green innovation and the quality of information disclosure. Furthermore, the study confirms the heterogeneous effects of institutional factors. Institutional deficits between home and host countries, along with the nature of private equity in enterprises, effectively enhance the value of the internationalisation of R&D for EMNEs on ESG performance. This study expands the exploration of the antecedents of ESG in the context of internationalisation, enriches the research on the impact effect and boundary conditions of EMNEs R&D internationalisation and provides practical insights for EMNEs to enhance their ESG through R&D internationalisation.", Purpose This paper aims to examine the state of research on environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in the context of multinational business research. This paper discusses research progress as well as various issues and complexities associated with using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the performance of multinational enterprises (MNE) and emerging market multinationals (EMNEs). Design/methodology/approach The paper identifies emerging literature that focuses on tracking the development and uptake of ESG ratings in the international context. It discusses three emerging research streams: Research examining the ESG-financial performance relationship in emerging markets, research tracking the ESG performance of multinationals in the various countries and regions they are operating, and frameworks for assessing ESG-related risks on a country level. Findings While the emerging body of work adds an important dimension to the identification and awareness of ESG issues globally, numerous unresolved issues become evident. ESG frameworks have been built to assess corporate sustainability as it relates to firms in their "home" countries (typically with a focus on developed countries), with limited applicability and transferability to emerging markets. International firm activities are often not captured in detail and not comprehensively mapped across firm subsidiaries and a firm\s corporate supply chain where ESG issues are prone to happen, and ESG scores do not comprehensively integrate views and voices from various local stakeholders that are impacted by firm activities, particularly indigenous communities. Research limitations/implications Research on ESG ratings in the context of multinational business research is generally sparse and fragmented, thus creating opportunities for future research to expand on existing and emerging findings. Practical implications The paper creates awareness of issues to consider when using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the ESG performance of MNEs and EMNEs: ESG scores can be subject to bias and are not weighted by materiality, which can be misleading for portfolio construction and performance measurement purposes. Managers need to be aware that ESG scores are often not capturing ESG issues occurring in supply chains and ESG issues affecting local communities. Originality/value This study enriches the understanding of ESG in the context of multinational business research practice.

This paper examines the inner influence mechanisms of digital finance on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) and financial performance. The results show digital finance is conducive to ESG performance while indirectly enhancing firms short- and long-term financial performance via ESG. Further, digital finance usage depth is the primary enabler for ESG and short-term financial performance. The mechanism analysis reveals that the positive relationship between digital finance and ESG will be enhanced by upgrading green innovation and boosting digital transformation. Moreover, heterogeneous analysis states that digital finance usage depth has a more pronounced positive role on ESG and financial performance in large firms and SOEs (state-owned enterprises) while coverage breadth positively affects ESG and is more pronounced in small firms and non-SOEs. This paper expands knowledge about digital finance via sustainability practice pathways.", With the continuous development of digital technology, the digital economy has gradually become a vital driver of global economic growth. We investigate the impact of digital finance on corporate ESG performance using panel data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2011 to 2020. First, we find that digital finance can significantly promote corporate ESG performance, especially environmental and social performance. Second, we empirically identify that digital finance affects corporate ESG performance through green innovation and external supervision. Third, our heterogeneity analysis shows that digital finance has a more pronounced impact on firms with low digitalization and low profitability, and firms in regulated industries and high carbon emission industries. The positive effect of digital finance is more pronounced for firms in central and western regions and non-low carbon pilot cities. Finally, our results remain robust after addressing endogeneity issues and conducting a series of robustness checks., The use of digital finance to promote firm environmental, social, and governance (ESG) fulfillment is the key to achieving sustainable development. This study uses the data of Chinese listed firms from 2010 to 2019 and China Digital Financial Inclusion Index of Peking University to empirically examine the impact and mechanism of digital finance on firm ESG performance. Results show that digital finance significantly and positively impacts firm ESG performance. Mechanism tests reveal that digital finance influences ESG performance by promoting firm green innovation, improving firm goodwill and reducing agency costs. Moreover, political connections negatively moderate the relationship between digital finance and firm ESG performance, while regional institutional development positively moderates this relationship. Subdivision of digital finance dimension test shows that the main factors affecting ESG performance are the depth of use and the degree of digitization, while the breadth of coverage is not significant. Digital finance can also promote firm innovation by promoting ESG performance. This study integrates the value effect of digital finance with the concept of sustainable development, which has important theoretical and practical significance.

Building on both agency theory and institutional theory, we identify and divide the ultimate controlling shareholders into three types: central government, local government, and private shareholders. This study draws on data from 2629 listed firms in China between 2007 and 2015. Our results suggest that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) controlled by the central government show the strongest innovation performance in all scenarios. In addition, private firms outperform local SOEs in terms of patent quantity in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors and in high-economic-development regions, whereas local SOEs outperform their private peers with respect to patent quality, mainly in the manufacturing sector and high-economic-development regions. Such an ownership-innovation nexus is then found to be more pronounced for firms engaging in more ESG practices, during periods of higher EPU, and when less corruption is present. These findings demonstrate the value of diversity in state capitalism in guiding SOEs heterogeneous innovation activities in emerging economies.", "We investigate the relationship between state-owned shareholders participation and the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of private firms. Based on a sample of Chinese private firms between 2009 and 2022, we find that state-owned shareholders participation can significantly improve the ESG performance of private firms. Our mechanism tests suggest that state-owned shareholders play a role in improving the ESG performance of private firms through resource support and governance supervision. Moreover, the positive effect of state-owned shareholders participation on ESG performance is more significant if private firms have lower carbon emission intensity and in industries with a higher degree of competition. We also find that state-owned shareholders participation effectively increases firm value while improving the ESG performance of private firms. Our results are robust after a series of endogenous and robustness tests. The findings of our study enrich the existing research on the economic consequences of state-owned shareholders participation in private firms and the factors influencing corporate ESG performance.", "Along with the intensification of global ecological problems, corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues have attracted extensive attention from the investment community, and solving these issues is crucial for sustainable development. However, little is known about the research on equity structure reform on corporate ESG performance, especially state-owned capital on private firms ESG performance. To this end, we utilize the panel data of 1,589 privately listed firms in China from 2013 to 2021 to explore the impact of state-owned capital on the ESG performance of private firms. The findings suggest that state-owned capital significantly improves the ESG performance of private firms. In addition, the results of mechanism analysis indicate that state-owned capital stimulates ESG performance through the dual path of improving the mitigation of external financial constraint problems and internal control environment problems. We also find that firms external environmental shocks enhance the extent to which state capital injection into private firms enhances ESG performance, and these external environmental shocks include the strength of environmental regulation in the region, whether the firms attribute is that of heavily polluting industries, and the strength of external media attention. In summary, our findings support the conjecture that state capital injection into private firms will be followed by enhanced ESG performance, and the external environment is a factor that influences this process. Our study may provide lessons for the sustainable development of private firms and dig deeper into the internal root causes and external shock factors."

The impacts of ownership and the governance mechanism of ESG assurance on corporate greenwashing behavior are also explored. This study employs text mining, OLS, PSM, IV-LIML, treatment effect models, feasible generalized least squares, placebo tests, bootstrap methods, etc., to conduct empirical analysis and conclude the following results: ESG assurance has a significant inhibitory effect on corporate greenwashing behavior, playing a crucial role in resource allocation, particularly in non-state-owned enterprises. The legal environment has a certain substitution effect on ESG assurance in inhibiting corporate greenwashing behavior, meaning that when the legal environment is weak, ESG assurance is more effective in curbing such behavior. Management shareholding also has a certain substitution effect on ESG assurance in inhibiting corporate greenwashing behavior, indicating that when management shareholding is low, ESG assurance is better at curbing such behavior. Further research reveals that corporate ESG performance plays a mediating role between ESG assurance and corporate greenwashing governance. This article provides policy references and empirical evidence for strengthening ESG assurance and enhancing corporate ESG performance and greenwashing governance to promote high-quality corporate development., "In the context of increasing concern about climate issues, corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance has received widespread attention from the public. Our study focuses on empirically analyzing the effects of media coverage on corporate ESG performance in China. The findings suggest that media coverage plays an effective supervisory role in improving corporate ESG performance. This finding is robust after addressing the potential endogeneity issues. Furthermore, we find that media coverage improves by increasing analysts attention and deterring agency costs. Our results provide effective suggestions to help enterprises achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals and to help the media play an effective supervisory role in achieving sustainable development.", Purpose - This study investigates whether Chinese local governments\ environmental attention can mitigate corporate "greenwashing", focusing on the extent of environmental content in annual government work reports as indicative of government environmental attention. This study aims to determine whether enterprises respond to changes in local governmental attention by improving the quality of their environmental information disclosures. Design/methodology/approach - Data from China\s A-share listed companies spanning 2013-2021 were sourced from the CSMAR database and company annual reports. Environmental attention data were manually gathered from local government work reports published on official local government websites by using text analysis methods. These datasets were analyzed empirically to assess the impact of local governments\ environmental attention on corporate greenwashing behavior. Findings - Results show that increased governmental environmental attention significantly reduces corporate greenwashing behavior by alleviating corporate financing constraints, enhancing independent engagement in environmental initiatives and bolstering stakeholder oversight. Moreover, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the influence of government environmental concerns is pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, firms with subpar audit quality and those exhibiting myopic management tendencies. Originality/value - This study enriches the existing literature on the government-business nexus. It also introduces methodological innovations by employing a lexical analysis of environmental themes in local government work reports instead of using typical event study approaches. Furthermore, it uses a mediating effect model to identify the mechanisms through which government environmental attention influences corporate greenwashing, namely, government subsidies, corporate environmental initiatives and external stakeholder oversight.

Design/methodology/approach: Panel regressions were used to analyse an unbalanced sample of 92 companies (725 company years) listed on the JSE All Share Index during 2011 to 2021. Board gender diversity, measured as the percentage of women on a board, was regressed against aggregate and individual component Bloomberg ESG disclosure scores. Critical mass theory was tested using a 30%+ female board representation dummy variable. Findings/results: Positive correlation is found between female board representation and both aggregate ESG and S-disclosure. This likely results from unexplained differences between company and overall economy level time effects, as no time series correlation remains between board gender diversity and ESG disclosure scores once these effects are controlled for. Little evidence is found in support of critical mass theory. Practical implications: The results, although not conclusive, provide support for the argument that greater female representation on South African corporate boards is desirable to attain higher ESG disclosure. However, both female board representation and ESG disclosure scores may be driven by the same non-modelled underlying process, likely controlled for by the fixed effects. Originality/value: This study adds to the growing ESG and board gender diversity research - specifically in South Africa, an interesting case of an emerging economy with well-developed governance and disclosure frameworks, where more equitable gender board representation and increasing ESG disclosure are topics of great practical and academic importance.", "Gender diversity on the board of directors can influence companies voluntary disclosure such as their environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG). A growing body of literature suggests that most of the work of the board occurs in committees, which are smaller working groups within the board. In a smaller working group, even a small number of women can represent a higher proportion of the group. Therefore, the influence of gender diversity on a boards decisions can be more prevalent in committees, since womens ideas and opinions can have more of an impact in smaller working groups. By being on committees, women have the chance to actively contribute to board tasks and decisions. This study investigates the relationship between the gender diversity of the board and its main committees and the ESG disclosure of Canadian-listed companies. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between female representation on the board and committees and ESG disclosure. Using a structural equation model, the results suggest that there is a joint influence on ESG disclosure of gender diversity at the board level and at the committee. level. In addition, the study demonstrates that for ESG disclosure, the influence of female representation on committees is higher than the influence of female representation on the board. This study shows that by being on committees, women can better contribute to board decisions and that the influence of board gender diversity is not limited to female representation on the board but also comes from female representation on committees.", "PurposeThis study aims to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and environmental, social and governance (ESG) controversies and to determine if a critical mass of female directors has a significant impact on ESG performance. Design/methodology/approachThe study analyzes a sample of non-financial companies from 13 European countries between 2004 and 2021. The primary method used to reach conclusions was the pooled ordinary least squares regression. Additionally, the study used supplementary techniques such as alternative measurement, sub-sample analysis and two-stage least squares to enhance its reliability. FindingsThe results indicate that a higher representation of women on boards is correlated with a reduction in the number of ESG controversies, particularly when there are three or more female directors. Furthermore, the relationship between board gender diversity and ESG controversies may be affected by factors such as industry, governance and a companys environmental performance. Practical implicationsThis study suggests that increasing womens representation on boards may mitigate ESG controversies and improve firm reputation and performance, especially in industries with high ESG risks. Policymakers can support this through policies, targets, training and inclusive practices. The findings also inform investors and stakeholders of the relationship between board gender diversity and ESG controversies. Originality/valueThis study expands the understanding of the relationship between board gender diversity and sustainable accounting and finance. It focuses on the effect that having female board members has on corporate policies, which is significant for shaping global policies that promote diversity on boards."

The studys data is from the new version of the Governance Guidelines for Public Companies promulgated by the China Se-curities Regulatory Commission in 2018. Thus, the data of Chinas public companies from 2011 to 2021 is used for the studys analysis. The methods applied for our estimation analysis are the differences-in-differences (DID) and the mediation effect model. The findings depict that ESG information disclosure policies can significantly inhibit the corporate value of heavily polluting enterprises (HPE). Enterprise technological innovation plays a mediating effect in this mecha-nism; that is, after introducing the policy, it effectively alleviates the information asymmetry and promotes enterprise technological innovation, but it also damages the enterprise value. Further analysis shows that the inhibition effect of ESG information disclosure policy on the value of HPE is heterogeneous, and for non-state-owned enterprises, ESG information disclosure policies have a stronger inhibitory effect. Also, there is little difference between the central and western regions and the eastern region in terms of the inhibitory effect of ESG disclosure policies on the value of HPE. The conclusion of this paper is conducive to improving the information disclosure policy of listed companies and promoting the green development of enterprises.", ESG information disclosure is an essential aspect of corporate ESG responsibility and has gained significant attention in the context of ecological civilization development within the socialist market economy. However, in China\s early stage of ESG development, challenges such as ESG rating discrepancies, "greenwashing", and corporate "cleansing" accompany ESG information disclosure. This study aims to investigate the impact of corporate ESG information disclosure on audit fees using a sample of non-financial A-share listed companies in China from 2011 to 2020. Drawing on the "deep pocket" theory, risk premium theory, and cost-benefit principle, the research examines the relationship between ESG information disclosure and audit fees. The findings reveal that approximately one-third of Chinese enterprises disclose ESG information, and substantial variation exists in the disclosure scores among the disclosed firms. The empirical analysis further demonstrates that firms disclosing ESG information tend to face higher audit fees, with higher ESG disclosure scores associated with increased audit fees. Moreover, an increase in the disclosure score of any ESG dimension (environment, social responsibility, and corporate governance) leads to higher audit fees. The study also identifies operational risk as a mediating factor in the relationship between ESG disclosure and audit fees. Additionally, media attention can dampen the positive effect of ESG disclosure scores on audit fees. Furthermore, the impact of ESG disclosure scores on audit fees is more pronounced in firms that voluntarily disclose ESG information before the implementation of the new Environmental Protection Law. These findings contribute to the literature and provide theoretical insights for governmental and regulatory decision-making, corporate managers, auditors, and ESG investors in China., As an intermediary in information dissemination and a guide of public opinion, the media represent an important external supervision force in corporate governance. It is very important to fully understand the supporting role of public media in the modernization of environmental governance in China to improve the quality of ESG information disclosure. Based on the data of companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index from 2015 to 2020, this paper finds that media attention has a significant positive impact on ESG information disclosure, that is, high-frequency media attention can promote the quality of ESG information disclosure, while different types of media reports can promote the quality of ESG information disclosure. Considering the characteristics of media emotions, it is found that negative media reports can promote the quality of ESG information disclosure. The shareholder relationship network strengthens the positive influence of media attention on the ESG information disclosure of enterprises through the information advantage of a "weak relationship". These research conclusions reveal the internal influence of media attention on the quality of the ESG information disclosure of enterprises and the regulatory role of the shareholder relationship network to some extent, which provides the governance perspective on and empirical basis for ESG information disclosure research, and it also provides a decision-making reference for promoting the quality of the ESG information disclosure of listed enterprises in China, enriching the theoretical research and practical exploration of ESG information disclosure.

Findings show that a higher ESG score is associated with higher executive compensation. The subsample analyses examines how business-group affiliations and environmental sensitivity affect executive compensation. Results reveal that business-group affiliated firms with higher ESG scores tend to have higher executive compensation than nonaffiliated firms. Moreover, environmentally sensitive firms with higher governance pillar scores, which represent better governance practices, show higher executive compensation. Finally, high ESG scores and executive compensation is associated with better firm performance., "This study uses agency theory to examine how board size, compensation committee, and CEO duality align the pay-performance relationship with long-term sustainability performance. We examined companies from nine Asian emerging economies with a sustainability score greater than 0.50 between 2010 and 2019. The findings support the pay-performance relationship proposed by agency theory in the presence of a robust governance structure. The relationship is more significant in firms with high ESG scores. Our study claimed that the compensation committee has a significant role in aligning sustainability objectives with CEO compensation, which improves the firms market and financial performance. However, board size has no discernible impact on the CEO pay-performance relationship. CEO duality negatively affects this alignment since the CEO misuses their power to influence the compensation committees role in tying sustainability agendas with the CEOs pay performance framework. Furthermore, CEO compensation is significantly impacted by firm size, which is justified by the complexity and increased responsibilities associated with managing larger firms. Conclusively, this investigation suggests that the inconclusive evidence on CEO compensation around the world should be studied with governance mechanisms. This study advances knowledge of agency theory and the connection between sustainability performance and compensation. The findings of the study highlight the role of governance structure in aligning executive compensation with sustainability to improve long-term performance. These findings suggest policymakers promote strong governance mechanisms that reduce the CEOs power to influence the board and enhance the independence of the compensation committee to independently design the executive compensation package essential for aligning executive pay with sustainability performance.", "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the direct association between firms corporate social responsibility (CSR) scores, CSR disclosures and executive compensation. This study further investigates the moderating role of CSR in the association between executive compensation and firms stock market and accounting performances. Design/methodology/approach This study collects CEO compensation information from the Execucomp database and CSR performance information from the MSCI ESG database. The final sample consists of 4,193 firm-year observations for 1,318 US public firms for the period 2009-2013. This study uses lagged regression analysis to test the direct and moderating roles of CSR in executive compensation. Findings Regarding the direct role of CSR, this study finds that CEO compensation is positively related to CSR performance but not to firms issuance of CSR reports. This study also finds a positive moderating role of CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and firms stock performance. However, the authors do not identify any role for CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and accounting performance. The results also show a negative association of CSR in the relationship between CEO compensation and firm size. Originality/value This study fills a gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence on the direct association between CSR and CEO compensation and how the association between CEO compensation and firm performance is moderated by CSR scores. The novel findings of this study will benefit managers, boards of directors, shareholders and other stakeholders, including regulators and policymakers."

Despite this pressure, ESG disclosure practices considerably vary by firm. Prior academic literature investigated country- and firm-level factors determining such variation, alternatively adopting the institutional and legitimacy theory. By combining these theories in a unique framework, this study investigates the extent to which social structures (i.e., institutional theory) and social legitimization (i.e., legitimacy theory) influence ESG disclosure practices and each pillar. Results obtained using a cross-country sample of 14,174 firm-year observations during 2005-2012 provide evidence that country-level characteristics such as a political system (legal framework and corruption), labor system (labor protection and unemployment rate), and cultural system (Social Cohesion and Equal Opportunities) significantly affect firms ESG disclosure practices. However, their impact is heterogeneous in that they either reduce or enhance disclosure levels and may differ by pillar. Results for firm-level characteristics related to a firms visibility (analysts coverage, cross-listing, leverage, and size) demonstrate a positive and homogeneous effect on ESG disclosure and each pillar. These results inform policy makers and regulators aiming to enhance ESG disclosure levels of the risk they incur when managing variables related to social structure and the benefits of exposing firms to higher visibility.", "This study investigated the effect of ownership structure on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure, firm value, firm performance, and audit committees as moderating variables in the Indonesian context. The ownership structures in this study are foreign, public, state, and family ownership. This research is quantitative and uses secondary data. The sample consisted of 140 companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2018-2020 period. This study used legitimacy, stakeholder, and agency theory. The analytical method used was partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that foreign and public ownership positively and significantly affect environmental, social, and governance disclosure. However, state and family ownership did not affect environmental, social, and governance disclosure. In addition, environmental, social, and governance disclosure positively impacts firm value. However, environmental, social, and governance disclosure do not affect a companys performance. Audit committees moderate the influence of environmental, social, and governance disclosure and firm value. However, the audit committees do not moderate the effect of environmental, social, and governance disclosure and firm performance. The government should make stronger environmental, social, and government regulations that must be implemented by companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange even though they are now voluntary.", "Environmental disclosure is the latest novelty in the corporate reporting field. In fact, it is a tool that can better represent the capacity of companies in creating financial performance over time. Therefore, this paper analyzes whether environmental disclosure (ED) practiced by firms listed on the ESG index affects their financial performance (FP) using the moderating effect of social and ethical practices. The analysis includes a linear regression using panel data from Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg databases. Panel data were collected from a sample of 523 companies listed on the North American and West European stock exchanges. The obtained results show a positive and significant relationship between environmental disclosure (ED) and financial performance (FP). This implies that a strong environmental disclosure increases financial performance while a weak one decreases it. Furthermore, the study suggests a moderating effect of social and ethical practices in the link between environmental disclosure and the firms financial performance. In fact, these findings provide interesting insights for academic practitioners and regulators who are interested in discovering environmental disclosure, firms performance, and social and ethical practices. These findings also provide insights to stakeholders and regulators on the crucial need to integrate more social and environmental regulations to promote sustainability. Moreover, this paper fills the gaps existing in previous studies that ignore the moderating role of social and ethical practices in the relationship between environmental disclosure and financial performance."

Financial reporting means that companies share their financial information in order to support decisionmaking processes for both current and potential investors, fund holders and all kinds of creditors. Along with financial reporting, the results obtained regarding the economic activities of the companies and the results of these activities are shared with the public. Today, it is seen that investor expectations regarding companies are not only economic and an understanding that takes into account the environmental and social effects of companies has been adopted. As a result, it is possible for companies to integrate non-financial reporting practices into their existing financial reporting processes and make integrated reporting. Integrated reporting provides financial information users with information about the financial status of companies, as well as their environmental impacts and social and corporate governance practices. Integrated reporting, which enables the information presented to financial information users to be more transparent and accurate, also ensures that corporate reporting is carried out in a healthier and more effective manner. In this study, the development process of integrated reporting both in the world and in Turkiye has been discussed; and also the current situation has been determined. By examining the integrated reports published in Turkiye on a sectoral basis, it has been observed that the number of integrated reports published over the years has increased., "Background: Ten years have elapsed since the launch of the international Integrated Reporting Council. Stakeholders increasingly question whether integrated reporting (IR) meets the objectives of decision-usefulness and accountability. Aim: The primary objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of IR by examining the interrelations between the integrated reporting quality (IRQ), sustainability performance and financial performance of listed companies in South Africa. Setting: The study is conducted in the country where integrated reporting is most established. The links between the IRQ of the Top 100 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and their environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores and multiple financial indicators are investigated over the period 2013-2018. Methods: The EY Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards was used as a metric to determine the sample companies IRQ. These awards were ranked according to four categories, namely progress to be made, average, good and excellent. Sustainability (ESC scores), as well as financial performance data (accounting-based and market-based variables) were sourced from Bloomberg. The panel data set was analysed by conducting a mixed-model analysis of variance and panel regressions. Results: A high level of IRQ was found to be significantly associated with high levels of ESG performance, as well as high earnings per share and high leverage. Conclusion: It appears that IR strengthens managerial efficiency and legitimacy in the eyes of debt capital providers in South Africa, while equity capital providers do not provide a clear signal of approval.", "Purpose Given the significant role of both integrated reporting and cost of capital in the survival and prosperity of a firm, it is essential to understand their relationship by investigating whether integrated reporting influences the cost of capital of a firm. This research paper aims to examine the impact of integrated reporting practice on the cost of capital of listed firms in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Design/methodology/approach The study covered a period of 10 years from 2009 to 2018. One hundred and forty-seven listed firms in 10 SSA countries were used for the study. The study employed panel data analysis and utilised a dynamic estimation technique called the generalised method of moments. Findings The evidence shows that integrated reporting has a negative relationship with cost of capital, indicating integrated reporting can reduce firms cost of capital. The results further showed that social, governance and environmental disclosures all have negative relationships with cost of capital, suggesting that firms that make these disclosures would have a lower cost of capital. These results are consistent with signalling theory, which holds that firms send a positive signal to the market about their performance and prospects when they provide information relating to value creation, predominantly environmental, social and governance issues. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of the study is the selection of only English-speaking countries. French-speaking countries may have a different reporting practice, hence a different effect on the cost of capital. Practical implications This study contributes to policy development on integrated reporting in SSA and informs key stakeholders involved in promoting and supporting the adoption of integrated reporting in Africa. Originality/value The findings from this paper consolidate existing research in integrated reporting and cost of capital by providing empirical evidence on the relationship between integrated reporting, its components and the cost of capital from emerging economies. This study contributes to the understanding of investors reactions to integrated reporting. Further, it fills a gap in the non-availability of literature on the relative impact of the various components of integrated reporting."

Based on the existing literature, distressed firms tend to hide their financial crises through earnings manipulation. However, as CSR can positively affect companies in terms of performance, risk reduction, and market response, the better a firms CSR is the less managers will attempt earnings management even if they experience temporary distress. Consistent with the literature, test results using Korean-listed companies show that distress increased earnings management, and we confirmed that CSR weakened the positive effect of distress on earnings management. After testing each of the CSR subcategories, significant results were found mainly on environmental performance, reflecting the globally increasing interest in environmental issues. This study contributes to the literature on distress and earnings management, which rarely considers CSR as a moderating factor.", Earnings management continues to be a critical ethical concern faced by companies. The management that conducts earnings manipulation may adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities to safeguard themselves from stakeholders. Engagement in ESG is sometimes viewed as a type of managerial misconduct and as a means to cover up manipulative practices. Thus, the key aim of our study is to investigate the association between ESG disclosure and earnings management levels in the context of listed companies in Saudi Arabia. We also investigate the influence of financial distress on the above association. Data were obtained from 304 company-year observations for the years 2014-2021. The results showed that ESG disclosure had a positive and statistically significant effect on earnings management. In addition, financial distress significantly and positively enhanced this effect. This shows that financially distressed companies tend to disclose more ESG practices and engage in earnings management. Moreover, through the division of the three ESG components-environmental, social, and governance-the impacts of both environmental and social factors on earnings management were found to be positive and robust, while the governance score was negative. The results obtained using diverse regression techniques and further tests were robust. This study makes several contributions to the ESG and earnings management literature. It also minimizes the literature gap by focusing on the influences of financial distress on the ESG-earnings management relationship. The study findings have implications for several stakeholder groups, including regulators, decision makers, investors, and auditors. In particular, it warns policymakers that some practices focused on ESG enhancements may be a tool for preventing other questionable practices., With the continuing rise of attention towards societal challenges like, e.g., climate change, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) becomes an increasingly important topic for companies. While there is no question that CSR activities are on the rise, the connection towards Earnings Management in companies is less clear. Therefore, this research paper not only aims to provide an up-to-date picture on the literature addressing this interconnection, but also provides a profound base for a more solid theoretical framework. Thus, it delivers a critical basis for further empirical analyses in this field. In order to illustrate this interconnection between those two topics, this paper presents an SLR analysis of articles published in the Chartered Association of Business Schools (CABS) or Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC), focusing on empirical analyses of CSR performance and Earnings Management. Overall, it can be stated that CSR performance has a negative influence on Accrual-Based Earnings Management, while findings on the influence on Real Earnings Management are contradicting. Furthermore, the relationship of CSR performance and Accrual-Based Earnings Management/Real Earnings Management is especially vague when the used methods are moderated by different variables such as family involvement or managerial entrenchment. While the connection between Accrual-Based Earnings Management and CSR performance is widely covered in the existing literature, the relationship between Real Earnings Management and CSR performance is clearly less outlined. This research paper makes key contributions to the existing literature, as it combines and structures results of conducted studies during the last ten years and elaborates on the differences on commonalities of the results. This analysis also suggests that other factors that possibly influence Earnings Management or CSR should be included in a future research model for upcoming analyses. It places the findings of earlier studies into the context of the Ethical Approach, creating a roadmap for the future.

These voluntary ESG disclosures aid investors in making investment decisions by evaluating the firms sustainability. However, ESG reporting is still in its infancy and there are no regulatory standards; consequently, it is crucial to understanding the value relevance of ESG disclosures. Using panel corrected standard errors (PCSEs), the study investigates the impact of ESG disclosures on cost of capital. The sample of the study covers listed firms from NSE 500 from 2011 to 2020, that is, 10 years. The present analysis offers the value relevance of enhanced ESG disclosure in the form of reduced cost of capital through reduced information asymmetry. In this study, we employed voluntary disclosure theory and legitimacy theory to investigate disclosure level in emerging market. The study found a negative association between ESG disclosures and cost of capital, following the notion that non-financial disclosures reduce information asymmetry and ultimately cost of capital (Chauhan & Kumar, 2018; Francis et al., 2008). However, individual E, S and G disclosure scores were not found significant.", The capital structure decision is one of the most vital financial decisions of the corporation that consists of determining the optimal combination of equity and debt for the companies that would reduce the cost of capital. The examination of the capital structure has always gained importance especially in the theoretical and empirical studies while there is no study of the relationship between the environmental, social, and governance (ESG), the ownership structure, and the cost of capital. In this context, this paper aims to examine the potential impacts of the ESG disclosure and ownership structure on the cost of capital by using a sample of 30 companies listed on the UAE financial markets (Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange and Dubai Financial Market) during the period 2010-2019. The data show that there is an increasing trend in the different non-financial corporate disclosures. The empirical results of various models show that the ESG disclosure, the insider and the institutional ownerships have negative and significant impacts on the cost of capital. Furthermore, the environmental and the governance disclosures reduce the cost of capital. This paper demonstrates the strong role played by the ESG disclosure and the ownership structure in reducing the cost of capital for the companies. These results would encourage the companies in implementing the best practices of the non-financial disclosures and regulating their corporate governance mechanisms., Purpose This study examines the effect that environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure generates on the cost of equity capital in the food and beverage (F&B) sector. Design/methodology/approach This study analyses a sample of 171 international listed firms pertaining to the F&B sector and headquartered in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific (developed), forming an unbalanced panel of 1,316 observations, spanning the period 2010-2019. We run a fixed-effects panel regression model to test the relationship between ESG disclosure and the cost of equity capital. Findings Our empirical outcomes suggest a significant negative relationship between ESG disclosure and the cost of equity capital. We find support for the notion that increased levels of ESG disclosure are linked to an improved access to financial resources for firms. Originality/value This is the first study that analyses the impact of ESG disclosure on the cost of equity capital in the F&B sector, taking existing literature a step further into more detailed and specific aspects of the relationship of focus.

This study also investigates whether the implementation of the non-financial information (NFI) reporting regulations influences the association between ESG disclosures and firms earnings risk. Design/methodology/approach To measure the impact of mandatory regulations on the quantity of ESG disclosures, this study estimates the average treatment effects using a propensity weighted sample. Then this study uses the difference-in-differences method to estimate the differences in the association between ESG disclosures and earning risk before and after implementation of the EU directive. Findings The results show a significant positive impact of the EU directive on the quantity of ESG disclosures for the sample European public-interest entities, which indicates that the mandatory NFI reporting requirements could boost the availability of increasingly demanded ESG related information. The enhanced association between the ESG disclosures and firms earnings risk during the post-directive period reveals that mandating NFI reporting also increases the quality of ESG disclosures. Originality/value Using the legitimacy and decision-usefulness theories, this study provides novel evidence concerning the impact of the EU directive on the quantity and quality of ESG disclosures.", "Purpose The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of the European Non-financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU) on firms sustainability reporting practices, especially reporting quantity (i.e. availability of information) and quality (i.e. comparability and credibility). Design/methodology/approach To test the main hypotheses, the authors select 905 treated firms from the EU 28 + 2 countries for a difference-in-differences regression analysis of dependent variables from the Refinitiv ESG database. Findings The results suggest that the Directive influences sustainability reporting quantity and quality. Treated firms provide around 4 percentage points more sustainability information (i.e. availability) than propensity score matched control firms and are 19 percent more likely to receive external assurance (i.e. credibility). However, we also find that the Directive is not the decisive factor in the adoption of GRI guidelines (i.e. comparability). Research limitations/implications The analysis is restricted to large listed firms and does not account for small, mid-sized and private firms. Further, cross-cultural differences which influence sustainability reporting are controlled for but not investigated in detail. The authors derive several suggestions for future research related to the NFR Directive and its revision. Practical implications The authors findings have practical implications for the future development of sustainability reporting in the EU and for other regulators considering the adoption of sustainability reporting. Originality/value This study is the first to provide evidence on the NFR Directives reporting effects across multiple countries. It adds to the growing literature on the consequences of mandatory sustainability reporting. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel measurement approach sustainability information quantity that could benefit researchers.", "This paper investigates the impact of Directive 2014/95 (hereafter, the Directive) issued by the European Union (EU) that mandates the disclosure of ESG information on ESG decoupling behaviour by EU-listed firms and whether the strength of national enforcement systems of member states plays a moderating role in this relationship. Using a difference-in-differences design and employing a propensity score matched sample of 3020 firm-year observations from the EU and the United States, we find that both the passage of the Directive in 2014 and the implementation of the Directive in 2017 have a mitigating effect on ESG decoupling. We also find that the strength of national enforcement systems has no impact on the relationship between the Directive and ESG decoupling. Furthermore, our additional analysis indicates that the effect of the Directive is less pronounced for firms that have their ESG information independently audited. Additionally, we find that the impact of the Directive is more pronounced for firms operating in non-controversial industry sectors. While the Directive is under ongoing revision by the EU Parliament and Commission to be replaced by the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), our study provides timely insights into the effectiveness of the Directive and its impact on ESG information."

However, little is known whether the investment in ESG endeavors has any implication for the cost of capital of an enterprise. The present study investigates the impact of ESG performance of top global technology leading firms on their cost of capital. Panel data fixed effects and random effects and generalized method of moment (GMM) regression estimation techniques have been applied to ascertain this relationship during a period of eight years (2010-2017). For a deeper insight, we segregate the cost of capital into the cost of equity and cost of debt. The empirical outcomes reveal that ESG performance is positively associated with both measures of the cost of capital i.e., cost of equity and cost of debt. It suggests that socially responsible top global technology leaders bear a higher cost of capital as investors perceive ESG as an additional financial burden and do not treat ESG costs as a value-added factor. Hence, corporate managers shall rationalize investment in ESG undertakings to curtail their cost of capital. Based on these findings, the policy prescriptions are discussed for the concerned stakeholders., "This study examines the association between firms environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and the cost of capital for the largest European firms listed on the STOXX Euro 600 in a large panel from 2002 to 2018. We find that ESG is priced by both debt and equity markets, although in different directions. While better ESG performance is associated with a lower cost of equity, the relationship is positive regarding the cost of debt. We also account for industry idiosyncrasies. The relationship with the cost of equity is penalized for firms lagging in ESG performance compared with industry peers, and the industry median corporate sustainability performance score is around optimal to balance the cost of equity and cost of debt. We also find that ESG is not influential in shaping firms cost of capital in periods of financial and sovereign crises. Overall, in the same research setting, we find that the channels of firms cost of capital composition behave differently in response to changes in sustainability performance.", "PurposeThis article aims to analyse the relationship between the environmental, social and governance (ESG) score and the cost of capital of 600 large, mid and small capitalization companies across 17 countries that are component of the EURO STOXX 600 Index. By examining whether ESG has an impact on the cost of capital, this article contributes to the solutions to improve the impact of organizations and societies on sustainable development. The article further examines whether the effect is because of the environmental, social and/or governance components. In addition, the article analyses which WACC component (i.e. the cost of equity, the cost of debt, the beta or the leverage ratio) is affected. Furthermore, this article analyses whether a high ESG score can substitute for a weaker legal environment.Design/methodology/approachThe results were obtained by using ordinary least squares panel data modelling to analyse the relationship between the ESG score and the cost of capital. The sample consists of companies that are part of the STOXX Europe 600 Index over the period 2018-2021, which is composed of 600 companies, including large, mid and small capitalization firms listed across 17 countries. The sample finally includes 1,960 firm-year observations.FindingsCompanies with a higher ESG score tend to have a lower cost of capital, but this relationship holds only for firms domiciled in countries with a weaker legal environment. In addition, these firms should not only increase their ESG score to create a more sustainable environment but also to reduce their cost of debt. Environmental and social factors have a significantly negative impact on the cost of capital only in countries with a weaker legal environment, while the governance component positively impacts the cost of capital by allowing firms to borrow more.Research limitations/implicationsThere is not yet a standardized taxonomy to define ESG, making the study dependent on commercial data providers.Practical implicationsThe new insights can be used by companies domiciled in countries with weaker legal environments to reduce their cost of capital. The results also allow us to know on which components of the ESG score to focus. It can also help policymakers, specifically those in countries with a weaker legal environment, to provide incentives to further stimulate ESG investments and disclosure, thereby contributing to a more sustainable society.Social implicationsTo achieve the sustainable development goals put forward by the United Nations, it is important for firms to invest in ESG projects. It is nevertheless insightful to know whether these ESG investments, which are currently observed as a cost, also provide benefits to firms and in which countries. If firms clearly see the advantages of investing in ESG projects, they are likely to proactively engage in them.Originality/valueThis article is the first, to the best of the authors knowledge, to focus on 17 European countries, thereby capturing divergent legal environments. This setting allows us to answer the main novel research question, namely, whether the ESG score can act as a substitute for the legal environment in which the company is domiciled. The article also goes further than previous articles by examining whether the effect is because of the environmental, social and/or governance component and whether these impact the components of the weighted cost of capital, namely, the cost of equity, the cost of debt, the beta or the leverage ratio of the companies."

However, this also implies that the firm was manipulating the sustainability disclosure all along. In this paper, we attempt to study the influence sustainability reporting has on the relationship between sustainability performance and a firms reputation. We study the impact of sustainability reporting on firm reputation through two contrasting and opposing effects. The first effect we study is the compliance mechanism based on the normative perspective where the firm complies with the norms and values of the related industry. Secondly we analyze the disclosure mechanism where the firm chooses what to disclose i.e., the firm manipulates its disclosure to maintain stakeholder interest or financial return. The disclosure mechanism is based on the signaling framework. We extensively study the sustainability reporting and sustainability performance of 56 Indian firms over a period of 5 years (2014-2021). We analyze how these firms respond to the compliance and disclosure effects in the short and long run and the subsequent impact of sustainability performance and sustainability reporting on firm reputation. Results demonstrate that sustainability reporting positively influences firm reputation in the longer run but not in the shorter run i.e., the compliance mechanism is effective only in the long run. We also find that the sustainability reporting has a positive moderating effect on the positive influence of sustainability performance on firm reputation in the shorter run only. In the long-run the sustainability report has no effect. This further proves that the disclosure mechanism is effective in the short run only. In the long run, the firm may be penalized for its poor performance. These results will help managers understand the strategic role sustainability reporting can play and how environmental and social reporting can be used to achieve higher legitimacy and reputation and hence maximize firm returns.", Over the past three decades, a plethora of academic research has examined the impact of debt capital providers, proxied by leverage, on firms\ sustainability reporting (SR) practices, indicating its relevance as a major determinant. Since the empirical literature remains inconclusive, we carried out the first comprehensive firm-level meta-analysis to reconcile the conflicting results from 112 studies involving 180 effect sizes across 32,953 firms spanning from 1989 to 2022. This provides a timely and up-to-date evaluation of the magnitude and nature of the engagement and influence of this significant stakeholder group on SR. Further, the study provides granular insights by dividing the overall effect on SR into three reporting dimensions-adoption, extent, and quality of reporting-to understand the impact of leverage on each and detail plausible reasons cited in the literature underpinning the positive or negative impact of debt providers on SR. The results show a positive significant impact of debt capital providers on SR, specifically, the adoption and extent of SR, but insignificant influence on SR quality, consistent with the findings of legitimacy theory. Debt capital providers\ sustainability information needs remain limited to the "act" and "extent" of disclosure and concern for SR has not percolated to "ask for quality," indicative of a rather surface-level care for SR practices of firms. Regarding the strength of this stakeholder group and its funding power, greater activism, advocacy, and informational sensitivity are required to encourage firms to engage in meaningful SR practices. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression techniques were used to account for potential conceptual and study-based moderators. Significant discrepancies were observed due to differences in content of reported issues, type of firm, leverage proxies, the sample period, and publication quality. The study emphasizes the need for proactive measures among debt capital providers to counteract the limited positive impact of leverage on sustainability reporting. By identifying research gaps and exploring implications for debt providers and companies, this study highlights how ESG-sensitive lenders can potentially steer firms towards quality SR practices. It offers valuable insights that could inform policy changes, foster collaboration, and advance the practice of sustainability-oriented lending., Voluntary disclosures of sustainability information have recently received considerable attention by investors, regulators, and public companies in improving reliability and integrity of corporate reporting. We examine the association between the quantity and quality of sustainability disclosures and earnings quality in the context of corporate ethical value and culture. We posit that sustainability disclosures of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance reports are linked to earnings quality, because of the importance of both earnings quality and ESG sustainability disclosures to investors and trustworthiness of corporate reporting. We collect our sample of 35,110 firm-year observations between 1999 and 2015. Using both difference-in-difference tests and OLS regression, we find that sustainability disclosure quantity is positively associated with innate earnings quality and negatively correlated with discretionary earnings quality in mitigating managerial earnings manipulation and unethical opportunistic reporting behavior. Further tests illustrate that sustainability disclosure quality can strengthen the positive relation between innate earnings quality and sustainability disclosure quantity and mitigate the negative relation between discretionary earnings quality and sustainability disclosure quantity. Finally, additional tests suggest that the relation between earnings quality and sustainability disclosure quantity is moderated by corporate structure and prior-year sustainability performance. Our results provide policy, practical, and research implications as ESG sustainability reporting is being integrated into corporate culture and business models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Using data from 45 countries between 2000 and 2020 and a difference-indifferences method, we find that mandatory ESG disclosure increases firm-level stock price non-synchronicity and timeliness of price discovery, suggesting more firm-specific information is incorporated into stock prices in a more timely manner. Mandatory ESG disclosure improves price discovery efficiency more in countries with strong demands for ESG information and in firms with poor disclosure incentives. Mandatory ESG disclosure also leads to other real market changes, such as lower stock returns, greater changes in institutional ownership and higher firm valuation.", I use the staggered adoption of mandatory environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure regulations around the world to explore the impact of ESG disclosure on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing. I find robust evidence that underpricing is substantially lower in countries with ESG disclosure mandates. High-quality disclosure environments moderate and tougher liability standards amplify the negative association between ESG disclosure mandates and underpricing, which suggests that ESG disclosure mandates reduce information asymmetry and litigation risk. The impact of ESG disclosure mandates on underpricing is stronger in countries with more pronounced environmental, social, and governance concerns., "We examine the level of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sustainability disclosure by firms between two regimes where disclosure is mandatory versus voluntary. We use the regula-tory environment between the United States (US) and European Union (EU) to compare ESG disclosures. Firms in the US are currently under a voluntary disclosure regime. In contrast, EU members are under a mandatory disclosure regulatory regime that began in 2017. We find that EU firms outperform US firms under voluntary disclosure requirements (2007-2016), and the ESG disclosure of EU firms further improves relative to US firms after the implementation of the mandatory disclosure in Europe in 2017. Our results suggest that the 2017 adoption of disclosure guidelines in the EU is associated with improvements in EU firms ESG disclosure. Our results regarding the value-relevance of ESG disclosure support a move toward mandatory ESG disclo-sures. Results support current initiatives that have been taken by global regulators and stock exchanges in recommending and requiring globally listed companies to disclose their ESG sus-tainability information to portray accurate and comprehensive corporate reporting. The results further our understanding of how firms from different institutional environment settings may have disclosed their ESG practices, thus providing opportunities for future research."

The findings are as follows: (1) businesses are more likely to engage in earnings management practices if their annual reports contain a higher percentage of positive phrases; (2) the optimistic disclosure tone of annual reports was found to have a negative correlation with independent directors and gender diversity; (3) a strong positive correlation exists between positive disclosure tone and firm value, with profitability as measured by return on assets supporting this association; (4) financial performance was shown to determine tone, rather than the other way around; (5) companies used a positive tone when there was no risk of bankruptcy while reducing their use of negative tones; and (6) the study demonstrated that disclosure tone, particularly negative and litigious tones, had distinct associations with the cost of capital and its components., This study explores the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework adoption, and ESG reporting assurance on the tone of ESG disclosures among Chinese listed firms. The research analyzes a dataset of 5985 observations from Chinese listed companies. It employs empirical methods to examine the relationships between ESG performance, GRI framework adoption, ESG reporting assurance, and ESG disclosure tone. The study finds a positive link between high ESG performance and a more optimistic ESG reporting tone, aligning with signalling theory. Conversely, adopting the GRI framework and ESG reporting assurance limits the use of positive tones, consistent with impression management principles. This underscores the importance of governance mechanisms in influencing responsible reporting and mitigating corporate hypocrisy. Additional tests affirm these findings, addressing potential endogeneity concerns. This study contributes to the existing literature on ESG reporting by providing empirical evidence on the influence of ESG performance and managerial tools on reporting tones. It establishes a positive link between ESG performance and ESG reporting tone and highlights the governance function of ESG reporting assurance and the GRI framework in curtailing managerial tendencies to manipulate tone. The paper bridges a research gap by responding to calls for more research into what drives the tone of ESG information. It cements the relevance of signalling theory in ESG and affirms that the deployment of GRI and ESG reporting assurance can serve as tools to inhibit impression management., "PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and tone management in the annual report. This is based on the notion that managers, driven by personal interests, may use their ESG accomplishments by using an abnormal positive tone to enhance their reputation or career prospects.Design/methodology/approachUsing panel data from Chinese listed companies from 2010 to 2022, this study first investigates the relationship between ESG performance and abnormal tone management. The study then uncovers this relationship is mediated through the mechanisms of equity-based incentive and analyst coverage. The conclusions of this paper hold even after a series of robustness tests, such as propensity score matching, Heckman two-stage method and two-stage least squares with instrumental variables.FindingsThis study finds a positive correlation between ESG performance and the presence of abnormal positive tone in annual reports. Furthermore, the mechanistic analysis reveals that managers in companies with strong ESG performance are motivated to use an overly positive tone, largely due to their vested interests in equity-based compensation. Moreover, in an effort to alleviate the pressure stemming from heightened financial analyst coverage and enhance the impression conveyed through analysts reports, managers with superior ESG performance also tend to inflate the tone within their annual reports.Practical implicationsThis study provides significant insights into the ongoing dialogue surrounding ESG-related equity incentives, which incentivize managerial manipulation of stock prices through the use of abnormal positive tone. The findings call upon investors to exercise greater vigilance in examining narrative information in annual reports, as abnormally positive tones may not always faithfully represent performance but rather reflect managerial self-interest.Social implicationsThere is an emphasis on the importance of robust oversight mechanisms within corporate governance bodies to curb the manipulation of tone for managers personal gain.Originality/valueThis study enhances the theoretical foundation of ESG studies, offering a holistic perspective on the intricate interplay among ESG performance, managerial behavior and financial markets, with potential implications for researchers, investors and regulators."

Such disclosure plays a crucial role in facilitating effective global business communication with stakeholders , enhanc-ing the credibility of ESG transparency measurements. The primary objective of this study is to develop and validate a robust model for a business transparency index. By leveraging mathematical tools, this model quantitatively measures the level of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) transparency, taking into account the requirements of stakeholders and evaluating a public company\s ability to disclose comprehensive information.The research hypothesis posits that assessing ESG transparency in public company reporting based solely on the "quantity" of estimated values, while neglecting the critical factors of "quality" and "reliability," undermines the accuracy and reliability of the results. By utilizing existing mathematical tools, a business value management model is constructed, incorpo-rating a balanced system of "quantity," "quality," and "reliability" factors present in the ESG information disclosed in public company reports.The research methodology adopts a comprehensive approach, combining logical and struc-tural analysis, mathematical modeling, and content analysis methods. A thorough examina-tion of the regulatory framework, international and Russian practices, and scientific research in ESG disclosure reveals the emergence of authoritative professional standards and frame-works between 2000 and 2023.These standards and frameworks play a pivotal role in shaping the disclosure of financial and non-financial information related to sustainable development in corporate reporting. However, a significant gap exists in established practices for determin-ing ESG transparency levels. Current "transparency indices" fall short in incorporating these factors, leading to methodological incomparability and gaps in assessing the "quality" and "reliability" of estimated values.To address this gap, the authors propose a novel mathematical model for the ESG transpar-ency index in corporate reporting. This model effectively integrates the factors of "quantity," "quality," and "reliability" within the disclosed information of public companies. Through a comparative analysis of disclosure and verification practices across various types of activi-ties within Russian public joint-stock companies (PJSCs), the established model enables the creation of an industry rating gradation. This rating gradation assists in determining the level of information disclosure about public companies\ activities, fulfilling societal (state) require-ments and optimizing business objectives., "In the 21st century business entities are required to change priorities and move to a sustainable relationship between environmental, social, and economic well-being. Climate and environment are phenomena of transnational and global nature, and for this reason, actions in this area should be taken at a supranational level. Nowadays, the European Union (EU) countries have been implementing directives concerning environmental changes and taxonomy for non-financial reporting. According to their requirements, public companies must disclose high-quality data in the ESG area, including the environmental indicator (E) and its components. The purpose of the study is to discuss the current state of disclosure of environmental data by public companies listed on the regulated markets of the European Union. Special emphasis is devoted to energy consumption, water, waste production, and CO2 emissions. To test the quality of environmental indicators, we used the Refinitiv database. The research period covers 2012-2021. The research sample consists of public companies listed on the leading stock markets in 27 EU member states. The findings support the clear advantage of the quality of environmental data disclosure in the old EU member states (which joined before 2004) as to compared to the new EU member states.", "One of the contemporary challenges related to climate change and effectively managing raw materials is to reduce resource consumption and the negative environmental impact while simultaneously increasing the economys competitiveness. This requires that business entities change priorities and move to a sustainable relationship focused on ecological, economic and social well-being. Due to the transnational and global nature of the climate and the environment, actions in this area should be carried out at a supranational level. In European Union (EU) countries, successive directives are implemented regarding environmental changes and the taxonomy for non -financial reporting. This forces public companies, as large public interest units, to produce adequate quality data reporting in the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) area, including the environmental (E) indicator and its components. The articles purpose is to make a comparative assessment of the current situation and to consider the prospects for environmental data disclosure by public companies listed on the regulated markets of the EU, with particular emphasis on energy consumption, water, waste production, and CO 2 emissions. The Refinitiv database was used to test the quality of the environmental indicators. Public companies listed on the leading stock markets in the 27 EU Member States were included. The research period covers 2012-2021. We focus on checking how many companies report environmental data in any given year, and those that present them for at least one year, or for three, five, or ten years. The findings support the clear advantage of the quality of environmental data disclosure in the old EU Member States (which joined before 2004) compared to the new EU Member States. However, reporting on key environmental issues (water and energy consumption, waste production, and carbon dioxide) is very incomplete."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The population was all listed companies in the SET. Using annual reports dur-ing 2015 to 2019, content analysis by word counting was used to quantify the level and pattern of ESG disclosure in corporate annual reports, while financial performance was measured by corporate net income. Descriptive analysis, independent sample t-test, correlation matrix, and panel data anal-ysis were used to analyze the data of this study. The results found that there was an increase of ESG disclosure in annual reporting during 2015 to 2019 by listed companies in the SET. The most common ESG disclosure was governance information disclosure following by social and environmental information disclosures. Moreover, there was the significantly positive re-lationship between ESG disclosure and corporate financial performance. Using control variables, stock reaction, firm age, firm risk, and ESG group had a positive correlation with corporate financial performance. The Find-ings can demonstrate that stakeholder theory can be used to explain the benefit of ESG disclosure, although the disclosure is still voluntary report-ing in Thailand.(c) 2023 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC. All rights reserved., The study aimed to (1) investigate the extent, level and pattern of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure in annual report of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), (2) to examine the different level of ESG disclosure between groups of interest in terms of board composition and corporate characteristic, and (3) to test the influence of board composition on ESG disclosure of Thai listed companies. Population was all listed companies in the SET. Using annual reports during 2015-2019, content analysis by word counting was used to quantify the extent, level and pattern of ESG disclosure, while board composition was measured by board size, board meeting, female board committee, audit committee, nomination committee, compensation committee, CSR committee, remuneration, CEO compensation, and board compensation. Descriptive analysis, independent sample t test, correlation matrix, and multiple regression were used to analyze the data of this study. The most common ESG disclosure was governance information disclosure following by social and environmental information disclosures. There was an increase of ESG disclosure in annual reporting during 2015-2019 by listed companies in the SET. Moreover, there was a significantly different level of ESG disclosure between groups of audit committee, nomination committee, compensation committee, CSR committee, and firm size. Finally, there was a significantly positive influence of board size, female board, compensation committee, CSR committee, and remuneration on ESG disclosure, while there was a negative influence of audit committee and CEO compensation on ESG disclosure. Finding of possible influence of board composition on ESG disclosure can demonstrate that agency theory can be used to explain the reason of ESG disclosure by Thai listed companies, although the disclosure is still voluntary reporting in Thailand., Purpose This study aims to survey the extent, level and trend of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures of top50 listed companies from Thailand, to test the different level of ESG disclosures of the companies between high profile industry and low profile industries and to examine the impact of ESG disclosures on the market reaction of top50 listed companies in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach Population and sample were top50 listed companies from the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Using corporate annual reports from 2015 to 2019, content analysis by word counting was used to quantify the extent, level and trend of ESG disclosures, while the market reaction was collected by the average stock price. Descriptive analysis, independent sample t-test, correlation matrix and multiple regression were used to analyze the data. Findings There was an increased level of ESG disclosures during the period being study. The most common ESG disclosures were social disclosure following by governance and environmental disclosures. Moreover, there were different levels of environmental disclosure of top50 listed companies between high and low profile industries, while no different levels of social and governance disclosures between high and low profile industries were found. Finally, the study found that environmental and social disclosures had a positive impact on market reaction, while there was a negative impact of governance disclosure on market reaction. Originality/value Thai investors can use ESG disclosures for their decision-making on investment.

Corporate social responsibility positively affects a companys business reputation and builds trust with customers who value improved financial performance. Objectives: The purpose of the study is to find any correlation between CSR and firm performance in Kazakhstan and allows for improvement of both the enterprise sustainable development management model and its assessment. Results: Analytical observation, monitoring, and comparison formed the basis of researching the CSR programs of selected companies. NPM, ROA, ROE, and NPM for leading Kazakh enterprises, the augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, and the Students t-test indicate a correlation between CSR practices and NPM, which is an indicator of profitability. Kazakh companies show a connection between CSR practice and firm efficiency, but this only occurs through net profit margin. The analysis revealed a relatively weak quantitative relationship between the main indicators of stock market activity for companies and their net income. The results provide the basis for the hypothesis that business activity indicators in stock markets today are influenced not only by financial performance indicators. One of the key factors influencing companies positions in stock market indices is their reputation (image) capital, which affects key indicators and ESG market ratings. Conclusions: Research data indicate the mixed impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on corporate financial performance, with evidence of positive, negative, and insignificant relationships. Investing in CSR can enhance a companys value if certain thresholds are met. Companies are recommended to invest more in the social aspects of CSR to boost competitiveness and profitability. The results of the study are consistent with the theory and confirm the fact that CSR practices and firm performance are correlated. The association between CSR activities and financial performance was tested, and the results show that there is a positive correlation among those variables studied in Kazakhstan. The social responsibility of enterprises in Kazakhstan should be considered in two aspects: as a necessary cost item and as strategic reputational investments that contribute to the creation of a more sustainable global world and positively correlate with the financial position of the company.", "Purpose - This study aims to examine the moderating effect of audit firm tenure on the association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm value. Prior studies provide mixed results on this association, which may be due to differing theoretical expectations related to CSR and firm value. It is also possible that external stakeholders are unable to differentiate between positive and negative CSR investments, as CSR reports are generally not assured by independent third parties. Thus, the authors propose that audit firm tenure may be used by external stakeholders to evaluate CSR performance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use an ordinary least squares regression to examine the moderating effect of audit firm tenure on the relation between CSR and firm value after controlling for other determinants of firm value and various internal and external governance mechanisms documented in the literature. The sample consists of 15,707 firm-year observations from US firms during the sample period of 2000 to 2012. The authors measure CSR quality using rating scores from MSCI ESG STATS (formerly the KLD database), audit firm tenure as the number of years the incumbent auditor has served the client and firm value using Tobins Q. Findings - The results indicate that CSR is positively associated with firm value when audit firm tenure is long but not when tenure is short. The results are robust to alternative measures of firm value, CSR performance scores, and individual CSR dimensions. The evidence supports the argument against mandatory audit firm rotation in the USA. Research limitations/implications - Future studies could examine a similar issue in alternative settings and/or look at cross-sectional variations among firms on the association between CSR and firm value by other auditor traits such as auditor industry specialization and big-name reputation. Additionally, as auditor alone is unable to ensure the quality of management disclosures and their accountability. future studies could examine the moderating effect of internal and other external governance mechanisms on the association between CSR and firm value, exploring when the signaling effect of auditor tenure on CSR reporting quality and its effect on firm value is most salient. Practical implications - The findings are important to regulators and investors. The authors provide evidence that longer audit tenure serves as a signaling device for external investors with regard to the quality of a firms CSR performance. Hence, the study facilitates regulators cost-benefit analysis related to mandating audit firm rotation. The evidence suggests that mandating a term limit on auditor tenure may have the unintended consequence of eliminating a signaling effect of auditor tenure on the quality of CSR disclosures under information asymmetry. This supports the Public Company Oversight Boards decision to forgo the requirement of mandatory audit firm rotation in the USA. Originality/value - Prior literature presents mixed findings on the association between CSR performance and firm value based on a variety of underlying theories (economic, stakeholder and contingency theory). Literature on mandatory auditor rotation has concentrated on the auditor tenure effect on perceived and actual audit quality as reflected in earnings quality. Relying on agency theory, this study posits that auditor tenure serves as a signal for the quality of CSR activities in the absence of CSR assurance reporting as CSR quality can be difficult to evaluate. The authors provide evidence that audit tenure moderates the association between CSR activities and firm value and longer audit tenure makes it more likely that the CSR activities are associated with increased firm value.", "In the past few decades, companies have begun to pay attention to the issue of whether companies that are engaged in CSR activities enhance firm value remains a subject of debate. From the perspective of agency theory, high-CSR companies can encounter poor financial performance and a reduction in firm value because of managers bad project selection. According to stakeholder theory, high-CSR companies face a positive relationship to financial performance and vament as a result of consideration for the benefits of stakeholders. This study collects CSR data from CommonWealth Magazine and examines how Taiwanese companies engaged in CSR activities affect corporate financial performance. The empirical finding shows that CSR is significantly positive to corporate financial performance. This result suggests that companies actively engaged in CSR activities bring a positive effect on firm value. Therefore, our evidence supports the stakeholder theory that high CSR companies benefit their stakeholders. Recently, there has been a change in the way businesses operate, with enterprises beginning to prioritize issues such as environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance. They coexist and prosper alongside these concerns. Corporate social responsibility is a broad concept of sustainable development, while ESG embodies the principles of how CSR is implemented. This study examines the impact of CSR activities on corporate financial performance among Taiwanese companies. The empirical findings show a significantly positive correlation between CSR and corporate financial performance, suggesting that companies actively engaged in CSR activities bring positive effects to firm value. The evidence supports the stakeholder theory, indicating that high CSR companies benefit their stakeholders. The empirical implications suggest that advocating for CSR could strengthen favorable relationships with stakeholders, thereby benefiting companies. In practice, companies dedicated to engaging in CSR activities can enhance performance and increase value. The research results imply that promoting CSR activities is an investment rather than a cost, urging companies to increase their involvement in CSR activities without hesitation. From an investors standpoint, endorsing companies efforts in CSR is essential, not only for shareholders profitability but also for overall sustainability. Policymakers should formulate comprehensive policies, providing incentives such as tax relief or support schemes to encourage companies to invest in CSR activities."]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We use Bloombergs Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Disclosure score covering the S&P500 firms in the period 2007-2011 which allows for the examination of both linear and nonlinear relationships to be considered. The results of the linear model suggest that there is a significant negative relationship between CSP and Return on Capital. However, the non linear models provide evidence of a U-shaped relationship between CSP and the accounting-based measures of CFP, suggesting that in the longer run CSP effects are positive. Most prominent among our results is that fact that by disentangling the ESG Disclosure score into its environmental, social and governance sub-components, we find that a U-shaped relationship exists only between the governance sub-component and CFP. A straightforward implication of our findings suggests that in order for CSR to serve the interests of the shareholders, a long-run planning and considerable resources should be dedicated at this direction, given that CSR expenditure pays off only after a threshold of CSP has been reached. Furthermore, the fact that governance is the key driver affecting the CSP-CFP relationship suggests that CSR investments should be directed to this component. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", Prior research on the association between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) includes conflicting perspectives and inconclusive findings as to whether or not CSP has a positive, negative, or neutral association with CFP. While Wang\s (2015) meta-analysis confirms the relationship between CSP and CFP to be significant and positive, in some contexts CSP and CFP associate negatively; CSP may need to receive "good management" support to yield positive financial outcomes (Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009). The study here tests and supports the perspective that "good management" occurs in configurations (Le., business models) with high CSP to indicate high CFP. A configurational theoretical stance implies that recipes of bad management with high or low CSP are likely to associate with low CFP. Configurational analysis supports this theoretical perspective. Building from complexity theory, a configurational analysis includes the propositions that complex multiple recipes lead to the same outcome (equifinality tenet) whereby variables (ingredients) found to associate causally in one configuration may be absent in another recipe or even inversely related in a third recipe associated with this same outcome. The present study employs a mixed methods research design (using surveys of senior executives, independent CSP firm assessments using ESG factors (environment, social (or human rights), and governance), and analysis of corporate annual reports of 82 mostly highly-global Swedish firms). The study overcomes the mismatch between case-level theory proposals and variable-based data analyses that is widespread in the relevant literature. The study\s findings support the core tenets of complexity theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved., Purpose With the Green Deal and Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, the European Union is driving forward its ambition for a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. For this reason, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion by examining how overall corporate social performance (CSP) and the respective environmental, social and governance (ESG) pillar performance affects corporate financial performance (CFP). In addition, this study aims to present novel insights by testing a theoretically derived CSP over-investment theory empirically for the German market. Design/methodology/approach The final sample includes firms listed on the German Prime Standard (DAX30, MDAX and TecDAX) from 2015 to 2019. The study includes a correlation and regression analysis using fixed effects on 363 firm-year observations to investigate the CSP-CFP relationship. This paper applies accounting and market-based CFP measures and uses Thomson Reuters (TR) ESG scores to measure CSP. Findings Overall CSP, social pillar and governance pillar performance improve CFP for firms listed on the German Prime Standard. However, the study provides evidence for a value-destroying effect of CSP over-investment in the social pillar. Research limitations/implications The implications of the study are ambiguous. First, firms can improve CFP when doing good, i.e. increase CSP. Second, however, CSP is a concept of decreasing marginal benefits. Consequently, managers can respond to increasing pressure from investors to be "sustainable" with the argument of CSP over-investment. Policymakers must consider materiality as a potential explanation for the over-investment phenomena when framing sustainable development programs, i.e. the EU Green Deal and regulations such as the Directive 2014/95/EU and the Regulation EU 2020/852. Moreover, the study sensitizes society that sustainability efforts do not exclusively affect CFP positively. Originality/value The paper contributes to CSP literature by revisiting the CSP-CFP relationship and debuting a CSP over-investment hypothesis on the German market. The results are highly relevant for practitioners, policymakers and society, as the study provides an empirical framework to evaluate CSP properly and reveals the importance of materiality in stakeholder management.

It also investigates whether CSR committees mediate the relationship between CSR mandate and SOCDS. Furthermore, this paper explores how business group (BG) affiliation moderates CSR committee quality and SOCDS.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a data set of 5,345 observations from the Bombay stock exchange (BSE)-listed firms over 10 years (2011-2020) to examine the research questions. Baron and Kennys (1986) three-step model is estimated to examine the mediating role of CSR committees on the relationship between CSR mandate and SOCDS.FindingsThe study reveals that the CSR mandate positively impacts SOCDS in India due to coercive pressures. CSR committees mediate this relationship, with higher CSR committee quality leading to increased SOCDS. Furthermore, the authors report that SOCDS in India is positively related to CSR committee quality, and this relationship is stronger for BG firms. Finally, the supplementary analysis reveals that promoting CSR committee quality enhances firms likelihood of meeting CSR mandatory spending and actual CSR spending in India.Originality/valueThis research contributes to the academic literature by shedding light on the intricate dynamics of CSR mandates, CSR committees and SOCDS in emerging economies. Notably, the authors identify the previously unexplored mediation role of CSR committees in the link between CSR mandates and SOCDS. The creation of a composite index that measures complementary CSR committee attributes allows us to undertake a novel assessment of CSR committee quality. An examination of the moderating influence of BG affiliation documents the importance of CSR committee quality, particularly in governance, for enhancing SOCDS transparency within BG firms.", Purpose This study aims to investigate the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure on firm performance, considering both firm profitability and firm value in an emerging market, India. Design/methodology/approach The study examines the effect of CSR disclosure on firm performance using panel regressions for the final sample that consists of 386 companies listed in the BSE 500 index, India. It covers all major players in the capital market for ten years from 2007-2016. Findings The result shows a trend toward the negative effect of CSR disclosure on firm profitability and firm value in India; this negative effect is mainly influenced by environmental disclosure score and social disclosure score. An adverse effect of firm profitability and firm value on CSR disclosure is also observed to underline the inverse relationship. Practical implications The study provides implications to consumers, investors, managers and policymakers. Firstly, consumers have to be more aware of CSR initiatives of companies, and they should support those companies to do more. Secondly, investors can use the ESG disclosure score as a signal for the level of CSR activities, which negatively affects firm performance. Thirdly, managers have to consider CSR more seriously and spend CSR amount wisely after proper research and not just to meet the mandatory limit. In addition, managers have to take necessary actions to make the public aware of the CSR activities of the company to gain an advantage in the future. Finally, policymakers have to give more emphasis on the promotion of CSR activities to reach the ultimate consumers who lie in the remote areas of the country, and more awareness has to be given to them regarding CSR activities. Originality/value The findings contribute to the literature by providing insights on CSR disclosure and firm performance relationship in India, an emerging market with increasing international attention where such studies are scant and less clear, especially after the amendments in the Companies Act, 2013. Furthermore, the measurement of CSR disclosure using environmental, social and governance (ESG) score is novel in the Indian context., PurposeWith corporate social responsibility (CSR) becoming mandatory, several firms in India have been compelled into spending resources on CSR while their business strategy and processes were unprepared to take up CSR activities, effectively. In this light, the CSR relationship with other business functions would be altered. Using Thomson Reuters data from 2010 to 2018 (pre-mandate to post-mandate) this study aims to re-examine the relationship between CSR and financial performance.Design/methodology/approachThe current study is rooted in the bandwagon-bias effect theory and uses a long-term data (2010-2018) of Indian firms. It uses Refinitiv Thomson Reuters ESG rating to measure CSR and accounting measures for financial performance (FP) to make a pre-post analysis of the impact that mandatory CSR regime has had on firms performance. The study uses the weighted panel regression method.FindingsThe relationship between CSR and FP is different when CSR was voluntary than when it has been mandated by Law. CSR has a positive effect over the FP during the voluntary phase but this positive relationship weakens during the mandatory phase. The waning effect of CSR over FP substantiates the presence of bandwagon bias effect which can be explained by the crowding-in of several companies engaged in CSR activities because of the mandatory CSR law.Research limitations/implicationsvFew countries have made CSR mandatory therefore CSR literature is limited. But mandating CSR is a growing phenomenon so this study augments to the body of knowledge. Until now literature generally converged on a positive relationship between CSR performance and FP but the current study shows altering directions to this relationship in a changing CSR environment. The use of the bandwagon-bias theory contributes to the theoretical approaches. Theoretically, the findings add to the body CSR literature and offer impetus to the evolving domain of impact measurement and reporting.Practical implicationsResults of the study offer a clear indication to managers that they need to re-strategise their CSR activities during the mandatory CSR environment if they wish to draw instrumental benefits of a positive impact on the FP of their firms. CSR expenditure is now a leveller so managers may either exceed the mandatory 2% expenditure as some firms did during the voluntary CSR phase or else design their CSR implementation plans to bring about a more impactful positive change. Communicating the impact of CSR to influential and powerful stakeholders beyond the mandatory reporting to the government is yet another way through which managers can draw benefits of CSR activities. Additionally to draw positive results from CSR activities firms may consider adopting international reporting and benchmarking standards such as the GRI and ISO 26000. Finally, the results of the study can be used by policymakers to make a note that the CSR law is causing a weakening of the financial benefits and therefore.Social implicationsThe results of the study can be used by policymakers also need to make a note that the CSR law is causing a weakening of the financial benefits and therefore firms are adopting shortcuts, by donating the required amount of funds. But donation of funds defeats the real purpose of mandatory CSR which is social impact, therefore the regulators may want to make the necessary changes unplug the gaps in the CSR law to ensure better adherence to the law in spirit and a real impact on the ground activities. Originality/valueWhile CSR-FP relationship has been extensively explored but limited studies have explored this relationship in a mandatory CSR environment and no other work presents a comparative view of the CSR-FP relationship, namely, before and after the mandatory CSR policy. The current study is one of the limited few studying the impact of mandatory CSR policy on FP, and the only one that uses the bandwagon-bias effect to explain the phenomenon of weakening impact of CSR on FP of firms. Bandwagon-bias effect has been used in studying consumer behaviour, where group effect impacts behaviour of individuals and with mandatory CSR policy, firms following the other firms leading to crowding in. Using the bandwagon-bias effect has found limited attention from the CSR scholars, the current study uses this theoretical basis and therefore augments the CSR literature.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Using actual firm-level CSR expenditure data and a quasi-natural experiment setup of a mandated CSR regulation in India, we find that firms complying with the mandate experience significantly higher stock market liquidity, relative to non-CSR firms in the post-CSR mandate period. This effect seems to be more pronounced among CSR firms not affiliated to business groups, with concentrated promoter ownership, with low institutional ownership, with foreign sales and having operations in multiple locations. Further, we find that firms spending more on education and healthcare projects as part of their mandatory CSR engagement have higher stock market liquidity. Our results are in line with the conjecture that mandatory CSR regulation could lead to reduced information asymmetry and improved social and reputational capital, and thus improve the stock market liquidity of CSR firms. Finally, we show that mandated CSR firms, having superior stock market liquidity, obtain higher market valuations in the long run.", Studies in corporate social responsibility find that financial performance (ROA and ROE) is associated with the corporate social performance (CSP). Margolis et al. (2007) observed that "the mechanisms connecting prior corporate financial performance (CFP) to subsequent CSP" is an important issue for further investigation. In this study, we examine whether different states of cash flow liquidity impact the extent of a firm\s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. If firms perform well in CSP, we assume they have greater cash flow liquidity as measured by the KZ index and Altman\s Z-score. We posit that firm engagement in CSR is negatively linked with financial constraint dummies, which are computed as above 20% on the KZ index, or an Altman\s Z-score below 1.81. In this study, we compute the ratio of CSR strengths to concerns for each firm, which allows us to assign a specific CSR \Focus\ for each sample firm. Based on data from MSCI ESG STATS ratings, all firms are divided into seven focuses: an Environment Focus (ENV), a Community (COM) Focus, an Employee (EMP) Focus, a Diversity (DIV) Focus, a Product (PRO) Focus, a Governance (CGOV) Focus and a Human Rights (HUM) Focus. Furthermore, a multiple logit regression is conducted based on these seven focuses to examine the impact of financial constraints/liquidity proxies on firms with different CSR focuses. Our results confirm a significant negative association between CSR activities and the degree of financial constraints/distress. Our finding confirms the view of Campbell (2007). For the CSR focuses, we find that in general firms facing financial constraints do not engage in any CSR activities, especially when the degree of financial constraints is assessed by the KZ index. Our findings are robust using various CSR measures and financial constraint measures, and potentially useful to market participants when making investment decisions. Our findings also provide greater understanding of the characteristics of CSR firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved., "Purpose Drawing on financial slack resources theory, stakeholder theory and signaling theory, the purpose of this study is to explore the two-way causality between liquidity and corporate social responsibility (CSR) by using the cash conversion cycle (CCC) as liquidity proxy and composite and individual CSR metrics. Design/methodology/approach The data were retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database covering the period between 2013 and 2019 and 20,016 firm-year observations affiliated with ten business sectors and 60 countries. The fixed-effects panel regression analysis is executed in the empirical part. Findings The results indicate that firms with greater liquidity proxied by shorter CCC engage with greater CSR initiatives. They also reveal that firms with greater liquidity proxied by CCC do not regard all the dimensions of environmental and social performance equivalently; they do discriminate them. In the environmental pillar, firms funnel their cash derived from shorter CCC toward eco-innovation and resource use, respectively, but not to emissions reduction. In the social pillar, higher liquidity fosters community and human rights dimensions, respectively, but not workforce and product quality. These outcomes are largely robust to alternative CSR measurement, alternative sampling and endogeneity concerns. The reverse causality confirmed that CSR promotes higher liquidity (shorter CCC). Thus, the bidirectional relationship between CSR and liquidity is confirmed. Research limitations/implications Although the authors wanted to consider a longer study period, they were obliged to choose 2013 as the starting period because particularly CCC data together with environmental, social and governance (ESG) data were not available in the earlier years. Practical implications Among environmental indicators, fueling eco-innovation most with greater liquidity shows that firms make a strategic choice for their long-term growth and legitimacy. Besides, greater liquidity induces greater community development and more respect for human rights rather than investing in workforce and product quality. Although this might be an outcome of the realization of a deliberate strategy and good for the society, not investing in the workforce and product quality may impair the long-term survival and competitive position of the firm in the long-run in the marketplace. The implication of reverse causality is that customers purchase products and services of firms that do good for the ecology and the community and they pay faster to those companies. Social implications This study highlights that liquidity management and CSR are closely interrelated confirming a chicken and egg story. Firms with better liquidity management are more likely to care environment and community. Besides, doing good for society pays back in the form of enhanced firm liquidity triggering customer sympathy. Originality/value This research provides new insight by examining the two-way causality of the relationship between CSR performance and liquidity, which helps highlight the impact of CSR performance on the companys ability to manage its cash and the benefits of having high liquidity on enhancing the companys concern about the society and environment."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

A panel regression with industry-fixed effects is carried out to account for industry heterogeneity. For robustness, the authors also carry out a matched sample analysis.FindingsThe authors observe a negative and significant relationship between ESG performance with COC and systematic risk, respectively. For the pillar-wise analysis, the authors observe that only governance performance is negatively and significantly related to COC whereas the environmental and social performances are negative and insignificant. For ESG pillar level analysis for beta, the authors observe that all pillars are negative and significant, thus making a case for how firms can fine-tune their ESG strategies according to each pillar.Research limitations/implicationsAs the ESG concept is still in a very nascent stage, data availability is a definite challenge in India.Practical implicationsAs ESG is increasingly becoming relevant for multiple stakeholders, this study aims to provide evidence that can potentially guide the regulators, practitioners, and academicians to address the contemporary needs of these stakeholders, while also doing good for the firm in the traditional sense.Social implicationsThe transition to a sustainable economy is a challenge for emerging economies, especially for a country like India where stakeholders are not only varied but also huge in number. With this studys contribution towards an incremental understanding of ESG, Indian regulators and policymakers can bring forward mandates as to ESG compliances that are rewarding for the firms and give them enough impetus towards complying with ESG norms.Originality/valueThe extant literature on ESG majorly discusses the relationship between ESG performance and financial performance. This study addresses the lacuna of the relationship of ESG with COC and beta in the Indian context.", Despite the growing demand for corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) engagement in response to the global complex crisis, the impacts of ESG activities and market environment on firm performance have not been sufficiently investigated. This study aims to explore how ESG activities affect firm performance and how the competitive market environment moderates this relationship. The panel data regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the ESG performance and firm performance (specifically, market capitalization as a measure of market-based firm performance and profit margin and return on assets as measures of account-based firm performance) with the data of 2115 listed companies from 53 countries over the past 5 years (2017-2021). The analysis results showed a U-shaped relation between ESG performance and market capitalization, and a positive linear relationship was observed between ESG performance and profit margin or return on assets. Importantly, it was found that these relationships are negatively moderated by the competition (number of competitors) in the market. It can be interpreted that the greater the number of competitors in the market, the weaker the effect of ESG performance on firm performance. This study discusses plausible reasons for these observations and managerial and policy implications drawn from the results. This study not only analyzes the relationship between ESG performance and various aspects of firm performance at the global level, but also accumulates new evidence for the moderating effect of market competition., "PurposeThe study is aimed at examining the impact of ESG on the financial performance (FP) of firms and determining the difference between the impact of ESG on market-oriented financial performance measure (Tobins Q) and internal productivity-based financial measure (ROA). The study has also explored the influence of managerial ability and institutional quality as moderating variables on the relation between ESG and the financial performance of firms (both measures of FP: Tobins Q and ROA).Design/methodology/approachThe study is quantitative exploratory and uses panel data of 687 publicly listed companies from the year 2013-2023. Data has been acquired from the reputed data providers and OLS regression has been used for panel data analysis with fixed effects.FindingsThe study reaffirms the positive impact of ESG on the financial performance of firms. Each pillar of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) has been found positively related to both measures of financial performance (Tobins Q and ROA). The study reveals that managerial ability and institutional quality, acting as supplementary variables, moderate the relationship between ESG and financial performance of firms.Research limitations/implicationsA limited sample comprising data from only 687 firms was used for the analysis. The latest data was not available, therefore, data from 2013 to 2023 was used in the study.Practical implicationsThis study indicates that ESG practices, which are mostly discretionary in Emerging Economies, can be induced through institutional pressures and ensuring higher quality managers. Policymakers in government institutions have to determine the inefficiencies, corrupt practices, and inconsistencies in policies that lower the effectiveness of institutions making them business-unfriendly. At the organizational level, policymakers need to ensure that responsible positions in the organization are held by managers with higher managerial ability. It is also to be ensured by shareholders that managers do not over-invest in ESG-related projects, particularly in organizations with weaker financial status. For managers, it is important to understand the positive benefits associated with ESG, even though they are in the long term.Social implicationsIn Emerging Economies, the official monitoring and regulatory mechanisms are weak, and lack a supportive attitude toward ESG initiatives. Voluntary and proactive firm-level environmental and social initiatives need to be encouraged and rewarded by institutions with public acknowledgment. ESG should be given priority by organizations for improving the quality of services and better social impact of businesses on society.Originality/valueMost of the past research explored the impact of ESG on financial performance in advanced countries or in emerging markets in a single/limited number of countries or industries. Also, past studies investigated the impact of institutional quality and managerial ability on ESG/financial performance in separate models. Conversely, this study has used a multi-country and multi-industry sample for more generalizable findings. Against the backdrop of the institutional environment of Emerging Economies, the study extends Institutional Theory and Upper Echelon Theory to include the role of managerial ability and institutional quality in the relationship between ESG and firms financial performance."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Many firms have recently emphasized the importance of ESG. Ascertaining what topics are being discussed around ESG and how they change over time will contribute significantly to gaining insight into ESG. Using 73,397,870 text data scraped and refined from publicly available Twitter data, this study applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the dynamic topic model (DTM) to ascertain the hidden structure of the ESG-related document collection and the topics being discussed. The study further conducts a sentiment analysis to examine the sentiment of the general public regarding ESG. Topic modeling shows that various topics regarding ESG are being discussed and evolve over time. Sentiment analysis shows that many people have neutral or positive sentiments toward ESG-related issues. This study contributes to exploring insights into ESG among the public and understanding public reactions toward ESG. We further conclude the study with a discussion of managerial implications and potential future research.", PurposeGrounded in the stakeholder theory and signaling theory, this study aims to broaden the research agenda on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing by uncovering public sentiments and key themes using Twitter data spanning from 2009 to 2022.Design/methodology/approachUsing various machine learning models for text tonality analysis and topic modeling, this research scrutinizes 1,842,985 Twitter texts to extract prevalent ESG investing trends and gauge their sentiment.FindingsGibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture emerges as the optimal topic modeling method, unveiling significant topics such as "Physical risk of climate change," "Employee Health, Safety and well-being" and "Water management and Scarcity." RoBERTa, an attention-based model, outperforms other machine learning models in sentiment analysis, revealing a predominantly positive shift in public sentiment toward ESG investing over the past five years.Research limitations/implicationsThis study establishes a framework for sentiment analysis and topic modeling on alternative data, offering a foundation for future research. Prospective studies can enhance insights by incorporating data from additional social media platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook.Practical implicationsLeveraging unstructured data on ESG from platforms like Twitter provides a novel avenue to capture company-related information, supplementing traditional self-reported sustainability disclosures. This approach opens new possibilities for understanding a company\s ESG standing.Social implicationsBy shedding light on public perceptions of ESG investing, this research uncovers influential factors that often elude traditional corporate reporting. The findings empower both investors and the general public, aiding managers in refining ESG and management strategies.Originality/valueThis study marks a groundbreaking contribution to scholarly exploration, to the best of the authors\ knowledge, by being the first to analyze unstructured Twitter data in the context of ESG investing, offering unique insights and advancing the understanding of this emerging field., "ESG reports contain crucial information about the corporations environmental impact, social responsibilities, and governance. Many compliance audits rely on answering questions based on these reports. Moreover, for tasks such as Scope 3 GHG emissions estimation, a company needs to look at the ESG reports of all its typically numerous suppliers to tabulate its own compliance reports. Manually finding specific information from these large documents is immensely time-consuming. This paper presents the first system that automatically answers questions from an ESG report, using advanced machine learning and natural language processing. The proposed system also locates and highlights a cropped screenshot from the report providing the answer. The authors devise two methods for inferring the textual answer, one based on a transformer model pre-trained for extractive question answering and another using a large language model. The task-agnostic method overcomes the challenge of the lengthiness of ESG reports in a cost-effective manner."

However, the actual logic used for ESG score calculation remains exclusive to rating agencies. Therefore, with the advancement of AI, using machine learning to establish a reliable ESG score prediction model is a topic worth exploring. This study aims to build ESG score prediction models for the non-financial industry in Taiwan using random forest (RF), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and investigates whether the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the accuracy of these models. The dependent variable is the Taiwan ESG Sustainable Development Index, while the independent variables are 27 financial metrics and corporate governance indicators with three parts: pre-pandemic, pandemic, and the entire period (2018-2021). RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and r2 are conducted to evaluate these models. The results demonstrate the four supervised models perform well during all three periods. ELM, XGBoost, and SVM exhibit excellent performance, while RF demonstrates good accuracy but relatively lower than the others. XGBoosts r2 shows inconsistency with RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. This study concludes the predictive performance of RF and XGBoost is inferior to that of other models.", "AutoML offers significant benefits in solving real-life problems because it accelerates the development of machine learning models. In contexts involving real scenarios like analyzing companies environmental, social and governance (ESG), where the dataset presents some challenges, AutoML is anticipated as a promising solution to address these complexities. Although researchers have shown significant interest in exploring Genetic Programming (GP) in AutoML for handling complex datasets, a critical issue that remains unresolved is the comprehensive understanding of GP hyper-parameters that influence machine learning performance. While GP-based AutoML excels in automating many aspects of the modelling, there has been a scarcity of research that provides insight into the significance of individual features and GP population size within the models of GP-based AutoML. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the models performance evaluation from multiple facets, including feature selection, GP population sizes, and different machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the association between Pearson correlations, machine learning performance, and the importance of machine learning features. The findings demonstrate that incorporating all the determinants as features in GP-based AutoML or relying solely on firm characteristics led to superior performance with an excellent trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate. Thus, higher accuracy results exceeding 0.9 of Area Under the Curve (AUC) are presented by the proposed models. The novelty of this study lies in its empirical evaluation of different approaches to GP-based AutoML implementation. These findings provide alternative solutions for business investors to identify companies with strong sustainability practices.", This study has two primary objectives. Firstly, it enhances the reliability and transparency of machine-learning-based models for predicting future changes in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Secondly, it explores the relationship between ex-ante expected changes in ESG and future stock returns. This study collects 3258 STOXX Europe 600 firm-year observations. In the ESG prediction phase, two machine learning algorithms (logistic regression and random forest) are utilised to develop ESG forecasting models. Hyperparameter optimisation and walk-forward validation techniques are employed to address issues of underestimation and information leakage. The machine-learning-based ESG forecasting models are evaluated using three metrics: accuracy, area under the curve (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR). Subsequently, this study investigates the relationship between ex-ante expected ESG changes and future stock returns using the predicted ESG changes. A positive correlation is found between ex-ante expected ESG changes and future stock returns. The supplementary tests also reveal that this positive relationship is highly and statistically significant among large firms and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, this study introduces a robust and transparent approach for constructing effective machine-learning-based ESG forecasting models using hyperparameter optimisation and walk-forward validation. Additionally, traditional regression analyses are modernised by incorporating machine-learning-predicted independent variables. Furthermore, the findings provide empirical support for stakeholder, agency and resource-based theories. Finally, practical insights are provided to facilitate ESG-focused investment portfolio decision making.

More precisely, we explore the value enhancing role of targets pre-acquisition CSR performance at an M&A transaction by focusing on the deal premiums. We also examine whether firms in the service industries experience a higher deal premium due to their CSR performance compared to firms in other industries. We use several data sources (i.e. MSCI ESG KLD STATS, FactSet, Compustat and CRSP) to compile the final sample of the study, 277 completed acquisitions over the period 1996-2018. We use ordinary least square regression to estimate empirical models and find that targets pre-acquisition CSR performance is positively related to deal premium. Moreover, the moderation analysis indicates that the positive effect of targets CSR performance on deal premium is more profound for firms operating in the service industries than those in non-service industries. The findings of the study is robust to different operationalizations of deal premium. Additionally, examining the positive and negative CSR attributes separately, we reveal consistent evidence with the prediction that positive CSR involvement of target firms increases the deal premium.", "This study investigates how potential target firms environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance affects bid premiums during the merger and acquisition (M&A) process. Using a sample of 5658 M&A deals between 2009 to 2020, we provide new evidence that target firms ESG rating is positively correlated to bid price, particularly when the target firm scores highly on their singular environmental and governance ratings, whereas the targets with high single social ratings alone are not correlated to bid price. Our results also implied that when the target has lower environmental and governance performance, M&A deals are less likely to face bid premiums. We additionally find that the target firms of non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) are more likely to have a higher bid price as opposed to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) target firms. Additionally, we find that targets ESG rating is positively correlated to target shareholder value creation, as well as being positively correlated to short bid deal negotiation times. Overall, our findings are in line with target-resistance theory, which states that high ESG performance targets can use their ESG advantages to increase their bid price, as well as increase stakeholder engagement and generation of post-M&A synergy.", "Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) expectations from stakeholders affect firm decisions. We investigate ESG acquisitions with a focus on how a pre-deal ESG gap influences how acquirers structure ESG deals strategically and their outcomes in terms of combined ESG performance post-acquisition. Drawing on relative capabilities and signaling research, with an international sample of 340 ESG deals, we find that acquirers with a higher ESG score relative to the target (i.e., low-ESG acquisitions) are more likely to target smaller firms, use cash as method of payment, and complete deals faster. We also show that low-ESG deals lead to an average increase in the combined entitys ESG performance in the 3 years after the acquisition, thus indicating ESG corrective acquisitions as an opportunity for ESG capabilities transfer and improvement. However, effects are influenced by an acquirers embeddedness in the European institutional context where ESG stakeholder expectations are more developed."

Ethical stocks which are characterized by moral-based companies\ activities and lower debt are expected to have better resilience during the COVID-19 crisis compared to nonethical stock.Design/methodology/approachThis study observes 589 firms of ethical and nonethical stock during sample periods ranging from March 2, 2020 (first case announced) to June 30, 2021. Panel regression, with some control variables, was applied.FindingsTesting firms in Indonesia revealed a significant difference in stock resilience, in which ethical stock has a better resilience compared to nonethical, with Islamic socially responsible investment (SRI) stock having the highest resilience, followed by Islamic stock and then SRI stock. This study documents a significant effect of some financial criteria on the stock resilience, namely, return market (RM), market capitalization (MCAP) and share turnover (TURN). Overall, after splitting the sample into different time horizons, this study consistently reveals that ethical firms have better resilience compared to nonethical stocks.Research limitations/implicationsThis study makes several contributions to the literature on Islamic finance, especially concerning Islamic screening with SRI factors. In practical terms, this study supports the argument that focusing on integrating environmental, social and governance criteria in sharia screening will improve the quality of Islamic firms. The "Islamic" label is not only a marketing label but also a quality certification.Originality/valueThis study can be used as a reference for developing Islamic finance more focused on sustainability issues including socioeconomic and human development by improving the quality of screening of Islamic firms. Therefore, this study suggests that the establishment of Islamic SRI index is very crucial and significant to promote ethical-based investment., PurposeThis study aims to examine the association between environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and cash holdings, as well as whether this association is moderated by Shariah-compliant status. The aim was to test the joint effect of two ethical precepts, namely, the ESG and Shariah-compliant status, in explaining variations in cash holdings. Design/methodology/approachA sample set that consisted of 9,244 firm-year observations from 25 countries from 2016 to 2020 was analysed using regression analysis. Firm-level data were sourced from Thomson Reuters and Refinitiv databases, while country-level data were derived from the World Bank and Hofstede Insights websites. FindingsFirms with greater ESG performances were found to have higher cash holdings. The positive association between ESG performance and cash holdings was greater for Shariah-compliant firms compared to non-Shariah-compliant firms. In support of the stakeholder theory, the evidence indicated that Shariah-compliant firms with higher ESG commitments also have higher cash holdings as part of their corporate strategy. Practical implicationsThese findings provided further comprehension to investors that ESG practices among Shariah-compliant firms are essential information during investment decision-making processes. Social implicationsThese findings highlighted ethical corporate practices through two frameworks, namely, ESG commitment and Shariah compliance; hence, contributing towards strategies to reach the Sustainable Development Goal 16 of promoting just, peaceful and inclusive societies. Originality/valueThis study has focused on the motives for cash holdings by considering the ethical precepts embodying ESG and Shariah compliance to uphold the positive impact of high cash reserves., This study focuses on examining the impact of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance on firm cash holdings and explores the various channels through which ESG compliance affects these holdings. The analysis is conducted using data from the United States. The results of our investigation reveal that firms operating in regions with high ESG compliance exhibit significantly lower levels of cash holdings compared to firms operating in regions with low ESG compliance. This finding suggests that ESG compliance has a negative effect on cash holdings. Furthermore, our study delves into the mechanisms through which ESG compliance influences cash holdings. We find that financial constraints and financial reporting quality serve as channels through which ESG compliance reduces cash holdings. In contrast, ESG compliance increases cash holdings through the channels of idiosyncratic and systematic risk. Additionally, our research highlights that the impact of ESG compliance on cash holdings is more pronounced in firms operating in regions with lower ESG compliance. This finding implies that firms in regions with weaker ESG compliance are more sensitive to the effects of ESG practices on their cash management decisions. To address potential endogeneity concerns and enhance the robustness of our findings, we employ the 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) and GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) cluster regression analysis techniques. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that ESG compliance plays a crucial role in determining the optimal level of cash holdings for firms. By understanding the impact of ESG compliance on cash management, firms can make informed decisions regarding their financial strategies and align them with their sustainability goals.

However, firms ESG information are beset with issues of information asymmetry. Hence, this study was set to provide a more uniformed statistical method of measuring firms social performance (SP); named ESG efficiency. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model was used to measure the ESG efficiency of firms in giving back to the masses by means of ESG contribution. Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia were selected for the study from the year 2010 to 2019. The findings were relatively consistent for all selected countries. The study found that ESG efficiency of both ESG and non-ESG firms had fluctuated, with ESG firms ESG efficiency fluctuating on an increasing trend. ESG firms were found to be more efficient in giving back to the masses, with higher mean technical efficiency (TE), compared to non-ESG firms. Furthermore, Pure Technical Inefficiency (PTIE) was identified as a significant factor in influencing a firms TE, indicating that the firms were purely managerial inefficient in directing their financial returns toward ESG contribution. Subsequently, this study provides a simpler method in SP measurement, and was able to identify the significant factor that affected firms ESG efficiency, and extends the literature on East Asias ESG development.", PurposeThis study investigates how the initiatives and controversies related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) explain firm efficiency.Design/methodology/approachFirstly, this study applies data envelopment analysis with the epsilon-based measure to estimate the firm efficiency of 80 companies in the Chinese energy sector in 2022. This approach accounts for the diversity and relative importance of inputs and outputs from a multidimensional perspective. Secondly, this study regresses the variables of ESG initiatives and controversies on the estimated firm efficiency scores through a generalised additive model, which can capture nonlinear patterns.FindingsThis study finds that a) the samples have i) about 49% room for improvement in efficiently optimising their resources and business outcomes and ii) the highest scores in governance initiatives, followed by social initiative. b) 69% of them have controversy scores that are greater than the average value. c) A cluster analysis indicates that companies with higher social initiatives have higher firm efficiency than their counterparts. d) ESG initiatives and controversies are nonlinearly related to firm efficiency.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings have practical implications for policy makers and managers who prioritise ESG, particularly regarding (i) the need to examine firm performance from a multidimensional perspective, that is, to measure multiple inputs and outputs simultaneously, (ii) the nonlinearity of the nexus between ESG and efficiency in graphical forms, and (iii) the need to balance ESG initiatives and address ESG controversies.Originality/valueThis study integrates statistical approaches in examining and ensuring sustainable growth and efficiency within the Chinese energy sector and beyond., "As global ecological degradation intensifies, a trade-off has arisen between environmental protection and production efficiency to achieve sustainable development for the environment, society, and the company itself. However, the potential reverse causality relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and corporate efficiency may lead to confusion. This study estimates the eco-efficiency of Apple Incorporateds value-chain counterparts in the first stage and creates values and profitability in the second stage of efficiency evaluation. Results obtained from the (i) directional distance function in the two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA), (ii) additive efficiency decomposition two-stage network DEA model, and (iii) network slacks-based measure model are consistent. That is, Apple counterparts manage more efficient eco-efficiency than profitability efficiency, implying that eco-efficiency is their competitive advantage. We thus also run a regression analysis to examine how the ESG ratings of Apple counterparts explain their eco-efficiency and profitability efficiency. Although the overall ESG rating positively explains the efficiencies, we found that the individual governance rating shows no statistically significant effect. The regression results provide insight for practitioners on the importance of investing in the three aspects of a firms collective conscientiousness for societal and environmental governance. This paper integrates companies eco-efficiency and profitability efficiency to resolve the conflict between environmental issues and production efficiency. It also analyzes in depth the effects of ESG and its three individual factors on eco-, profitability, and average efficiencies. The diversity of research methods also provides new ideas for future research related to firm efficiency."

In the palm oil sector, companies are addressing ESG risks by adopting and disclosing ESG efforts to improve access to financing. This study seeks to broaden existing research on ESG transparency and firms financial indicators by using firm valuation as a financial indicator and investigating the moderating role of firm size in the palm oil sector. It first investigates whether ESG transparency has a direct positive or negative effect on firm valuation. Transparency is measured using the Zoological Society of Londons (ZSL) Sustainability Policy Transparency Toolkit (SPOTT) 2021 assessment, which provides scores for palm oil companies total, environmental, social, and governance disclosures. Firm valuation is measured by the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), a widely used ratio calculated by dividing the share price by earnings per share. The study also explores the moderating role of firm size, using accounting-based measures such as revenue and assets, in strengthening the relationship between ESG transparency and firm valuation. The results show statistically significant negative relationships between ESG transparency and firm valuation. Companies with stronger ESG transparency are valued at a discount relative to companies with weaker ESG transparency. Additionally, the results find that firm size plays a moderating role such that larger firms strengthen the negative relationships between all transparency measures and firm valuation. These findings encourage constructive action for various stakeholders and provide implications for future research to support mainstreaming sustainable palm oil.", "Purpose - This study aims to understand the relationship between a companys sustainability (ESG) disclosures and its valuation. In addition, it also seeks to analyse the moderating effect of firm size on the association between ESG disclosures and firm valuation. Design/methodology/approach - The NIFTY 200 index comprising Indias top 200 companies by market capitalisation from different industrial sectors was chosen for this study. The sample period was from 2017 to 2022. The fixed effect regression analysis was conducted on the panel data for analysis purposes. Findings - A positive influence of ESG disclosures on firm value was observed, primarily owing to the environmental and social disclosures. Interestingly, the moderating impact of firm size on the linkage between ESG disclosures and firm value was found to be negative. Originality/value - Most extant literature show a positive association between ESG disclosures and firm valuation, which was also observed in our study. However, the study results indicate that larger firms are less likely to benefit from the ESG - firm valuation relationship rather than small firms. This could have key policy-level implications for smaller firms from emerging nations that usually refrain from sustainability disclosures.", "The present research aims to analyse the effect of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure on firm value using a sample of Indian-listed firms. The current research adopts cross-sectional regression analysis approach to analyse the financial data of 940 sample firms. The market-to-book value ratio and Tobins Q ratio are considered as market value indicators whereas ESG disclosure has been measured as indicator variable from annual report. The results conclude that ESG disclosure has significant positive effect on the market value of the sample firms. Further, the study also analyses the effect of carbon-sensitivity on this relation and found that carbon-sensitive firms experience lower intensity of the positive effect on firm value as compared to others. The findings provide significant implications for managers who can use ESG related disclosures to enhance the firm value. Besides, policymakers can also use the present findings to convey the positive impact of ESG performance and thereby improve the adoption of sustainable and socially desirable business practices. The present study provides pioneering evidence on the firm value effect of ESG disclosure in the context of one of the largest growing economies. The ESG disclosure and firm value nexus has been underexplored in emerging countries, and hence present research adds value to the existing literature."

These complementary non-financial ESG scores should provide information about companies ESG performance and risks. However, the extent of not yet published ESG information makes the reliability of ESG scores questionable. To explicitly capture the not yet published information on ESG category scores, a new pillar, the so-called Missing (M) pillar, is proposed and added to the new definition of the Environmental, Social, Governance, and Missing (ESGM) scores. By relying on the data provided by Refinitiv, we show that the ESGM scores strengthen the companies risk relationship. These new scores could benefit investors and practitioners as ESG exclusion strategies using only ESG scores might exclude assets with a low score solely because of their missing information and not necessarily because of a low ESG merit.", Purpose - Most companies rarely work on sustainable development as a whole, which includes environmental, social, governance, and economic pillars. The purpose of this paper is to explore causal relationships between pillar scores and overall score of sustainability and identify the most critical pillar to which policy makers should allot limited resources with the highest priority. Design/methodology/approach - Based on Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database of global corporate sustainability, this paper examines the causal relations between pillar scores and overall score of sustainability by using the three-stage integrative methodology consisting of cluster analysis, data mining, and partial least square path modeling. Findings - This paper finds that each pillar has unequal effects on the overall corporate sustainability and that the overall score is affected by not only the direct effects from pillar scores but also the indirect effects from the causal interrelations among pillars. Moreover, the patterns of causal directions and the most critical pillar are sensitive to industries. Social performance is the most critical pillar for the majority of industries, followed by environmental performance, and economic performance, respectively. The governance performance, however, is not the most critical pillar in any industry. Practical implications - To construct a roadmap for reform priorities, policy makers should follow the top-down approach which involves hierarchical decisions. Using the three-stage methodology, the policy makers first decide on the most critical pillar score before selecting the most critical category score underneath. Originality/value - Relaxing traditional assumptions of simple average overall score of corporate sustainability, the three-stage integrative framework allows for causal interrelations among pillars and different weights on individual pillars., "The effect of considering the financial materiality of ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues on firms ESG performance scores and rankings is investigated using Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) ESG Ratings and the financial Materiality Map(R) developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB). Results show that when financial materiality is applied, firms ESG performance scores change significantly. Further corroboration is provided by significant changes in firms ESG rankings when ESG performance assessment is based on SASB-adjusted ESG performance scores. Environmental pillar issues, and particularly natural resource use, are predominantly responsible for the changes. Overall, the results suggest that financial materiality affects the informative value of ESG scores and rankings, allowing the identification of investment opportunities in firms with high scores on business-critical ESG issues. We argue that consideration of financial materiality can better inform investment decisions based on ESG performance. This study adds to the understanding and assessment of ESG performance and its information content."

In contrast, news reporting data, characterized by its objectivity, timeliness, publicity, and sociality, has been a crucial source of quality market information for investors. The potential of ESG-related news as a robust complement to the data sources used in existing ESG rating systems merits further exploration. This study investigates the impact of ESG-related news on the Chinese stock market, with the goal of providing compelling evidence for integrating news media into ESG assessments. By analyzing 32,296 ESG-related news articles covering 3643 companies in the Chinese market from 2015 to 2021, we utilize event study methodology to assess the markets abnormal returns in response to ESG-related news. Our findings suggest a significant market impact from ESG-related news, indicating that investors are increasingly attentive to information pertaining to ESG issues. The study also reveals that different attributes of ESG-related news have diverse effects on the market. Specifically, news with negative sentiments has the most significant impact, and investors demonstrate a stronger reaction to ESG-related news disseminated through unofficial media. Furthermore, the study highlights that enterprise heterogeneity affects the impact of ESG-related news, with companies in the secondary and tertiary industries showing higher sensitivity. Privately-owned enterprises are found to be more influenced by such news compared to state-owned enterprises. This study offers a novel perspective in evaluating corporate ESG performance using news media, proposing a more effective and objective method to assess and manage corporate sustainability in a dynamic market landscape.", We investigate the response of shareholders to Environmental, Social, and Governance-related reputational risk (ESG-risk), focusing exclusively on the impact of social media. Using a dataset of 114 million tweets about firms listed on the S&P100 index between 2016 and 2022, we extract conversations discussing ESG matters. In an event study design, we define events as unusual spikes in message posting activity linked to ESG-risk, and we then examine the corresponding changes in the returns of related assets. By focusing on social media, we gain insight into public opinion and investor sentiment, an aspect not captured through ESG controversies news alone. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to distinctly separate the reputational impact on social media from the physical costs associated with negative ESG controversy news. Our results show that the occurrence of an ESG-risk event leads to a statistically significant average reduction of 0.29% in abnormal returns. Furthermore, our study suggests this effect is predominantly driven by Social and Governance categories, along with the "Environmental Opportunities"subcategory. Our research highlights the considerable impact of social media on financial markets, particularly in shaping shareholders\ perception of ESG reputation. We formulate several policy implications based on our findings., The relation between corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and firm value has received increasing attention. However, the recent literature on corporate ESG performance evaluation suffers from potentially biased data sources, incomplete coverage, and uncertainty among agencies. The objectivity, timeliness, and breadth of news allow the media to provide a good perspective on ESG instead. This study investigated the effects of ESG-related news on the stock market to confirm that news is a helpful complement to the assessment of ESG performance. The results show that 1) ESG news has a greater and more significant impact on the stock market than news unrelated to ESG. 2) Of the three fields of ESG news, environmental news has a greater and more significant impact, which varies widely by topic. 3) Environmental news has different impacts on listed firms in different regions. This study provides new ideas for a complete and objective assessment of corporate ESG performance and the management of a corporate media image from the use of ESG news.

Design/methodology/approach Using data culled from 4,458 observations from 60 different countries for 10 years (2008-2017), an independent variable derived from environmental, social and governance (ESG) score are regressed against dependent manufacture performance indicator variables return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobins Q (TQ). Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: firm-specific and macroeconomic. Findings The findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is a significant negative relationship between ESG and market performance (TQ). However, there is no significant effect of ESG on both operational (ROA) and financial performance (ROE). Moreover, the findings elicited from the partial least square structural equation modeling the relationship between ESG and ROA is stronger in emerging than in developed economies. Practical implications The authors opinion for policy makers is that it is essential to promote and implement the appropriate legislative framework for sustainability reporting, which should enhance both the sustainability practices as well the profitability of IT firms. Originality/value The model in this study presents a valuable analytical framework for exploring sustainability disclosure as a driver of performance in telecommunication and IT sectors economies. In addition, this study highlights telecommunication and IT sectors management lacunae manifesting in terms of the weak nexus between each component of ESG and IT sectors performance.", "Purpose This study investigates the relationship between the level of sustainability reporting and Food Industry Performance (operational, financial and market). Design/methodology/approach Using data culled from 1426 observations from 31 different countries for ten years (2008-2017), an independent variable derived from environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) score is regressed against dependent manufacture performance indicator variables return on assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Tobins Q (TQ). Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: firm-specific and macroeconomic. Findings The findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between ESG and financial performance (ROE). However, there is no significant relationship between ESG and operational performance (ROA) and market performance (TQ). Originality/value This paper presents a new framework that considers sustainability reporting as an innovation tool, examining innovation in terms of its positive or negative impact on financial performance. It contributes to research on the innovation paradigm and knowledge management by highlighting the significance of sustainability reporting as a tool of innovation in enhancing the financial performance.", "This study investigates the relationship between the level of sustainability reporting and retail sectors performance (operational, financial and market).

Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: firm-specific and macroeconomic. The findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between ESG and operational performance (ROA), financial performance (ROE) and market performance (TQ). The model in this study presents a valuable analytical framework for exploring sustainability reporting as a driver of performance in retail sectors economies. In addition, the results of this study has significant implications for retailers, as it allows the current retailers to consider the possible sustainable activities for better outcomes, and encourages newcomers to find different sustainability approaches to attempt to offer better returns."

This research has three contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge this is the first article to focus on large family firms considering their greater importance in stock ownership around the world. Second, this sample covers both developing and emerging nations. Third, our study not only establishes a connection between ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria and dividend payments but also considers how financial constraints moderate the relationship between ESG scores and dividend payments. The results indicate a positive influence of ESG scores on dividend payments. Furthermore, financial constraints of family firms are negatively related to dividend payments. Finally, the moderating effect of financial constraints on the relationship between dividend payment and ESG show that for high levels of financial constraints that dividends are less sensitive to ESG score. The opposite effect is reported when firms show low levels of financial constraints. Practically speaking, the study demonstrates the value of creating a dividend policy that is in line with the ESG score because they are complementary signals. Additionally, it is important to consider financial limitations when planning financial reserves in family firms. This is due to the diminished correlation between ESG score and dividend payments in the presence of financial constraints., This research aimed to analyze the effects of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure on dividend policies of Brazilian companies. To achieve this goal, a descriptive documentary research employing a quantitative approach (Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic) was conducted from 2015 to 2020, involving a sample of 104 companies. The results revealed that ESG disclosure contribute to the stability of dividend payments made by Brazilian companies from one year to the next. The results suggest that companies with higher ESG disclosure tend to have a more stable dividend payout. Regarding the effects of ESG disclosure on dividend payments, the findings revealed that increased investments in general ESG and its pillars make companies distribute dividends to shareholders. Concerning the value of dividends paid, only the pillar of corporate governance enhances this variable. Based on these findings, the conclusion was drawn that companies with higher ESG disclosure reveal better long-term alignment with shareholders and stakeholders due to more stable profit sharing. This research contributes to the dividend policy literature by highlighting the relatively unexplored determining potential of ESG disclosure within these policies. In addition, it contributes by revealing that involvement in ESG initiatives encourages companies to increase dividend payments and uphold stability. This, in turn, fosters heightened investor motivation to invest in socially responsible companies., We examine whether the dividend policy of high-tech firms is explained by ESG performance in the triple ESG components (environmental, social, and governance). Using a panel of US-based firms in the technology sector from 2002 to 2021, we find that better ESG scores are linked with a higher likelihood of dividend payments, stability of the amount paid, and implied shareholder returns from the dividend yield. R&D intensity is a constraint of dividend policies, although ESG scores mitigate this adverse effect by helping increase the likelihood of dividend payments. Overall, our findings highlight the role of ESG scores in enabling high-tech firms to implement dividend policies that yield stable returns to investors.

In addition, this paper also investigate the CSR information efficiency of analysts vis-a-vis that of investors.Design/methodology/approachThis paper measures CSR activities by using CSR strength and CSR concern scores from the Morgan Stanley Capital International Environmental, Social and Governance database. This paper uses analysts earnings forecast errors and dispersion as proxies for their information efficiency. To compare the CSR information efficiency of analysts to that of investors, this paper uses the Vt/Pt ratio, which is the equity value estimates inferred from analysts earnings forecasts (a proxy for analysts CSR information efficiency) to the stock price of the focal company (a proxy for investors CSR information efficiency).FindingsThe regression analysis indicates that analysts earnings forecasts are optimistically biased and more dispersed for firms with positive CSR activities. The paper also finds that analysts forecasts are more optimistically biased than investors in interpreting CSR activities.Practical implicationsThe lack of standardized protocols in CSR reporting and activities has raised the risk of mispricing by analysts, threatening the stability of sustainable investments. This paper suggests that regulators and standard-setters should establish a uniform framework governing firms CSR activities, along with their reporting and measurement, to ensure more consistent and reliable evaluations of CSR practices.Social implicationsAnalysts mispricing of CSR activities may distort sustainable investing, as it can overly focus on the positive impacts of stakeholder theory, overlooking agency theorys warnings about managerial self-interest. Investors need to assess CSR efforts with a dual perspective, acknowledging their societal value but also examining their alignment with shareholder interests.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge, this research is the first to assess the efficiency of analysts versus investors in processing CSR information amidst growing sustainable investment interests. Furthermore, building on Dhaliwal et al. (2012), which found that voluntary CSR disclosures correlate with more accurate analyst forecasts, this research provides fresh perspectives on the evolving nature of how analysts assimilate CSR information over time.", "We investigate the effect of corporate sustainability on analysts forecast accuracy. Specifically, this paper documents how financial analysts respond to environmental, social and governance factors (hereinafter ESG) in earnings forecasts. Using a novel dataset from the Bloomberg ESG ratings, we find that ESG ratings increase analysts forecast accuracy by reducing information risks and operation risks. The results are robust to a series of robustness checks, including propensity score matching, Heckman two-stage estimation, staggered difference-in-differences (DID), placebo test, firm and year fixed effects and alternative proxies. The effect of ESG ratings on analysts forecast accuracy is more pronounced for firms audited by accounting firms with low industry expertise and for firms tracked by analysts with low industry expertise. This paper responds to the calls for more research on ESG ratings and analysts earnings forecast accuracy and provides implications that ESG assurance can effectively improve the quality of nonfinancial information of a company. In addition, the paper is valuable for policymakers to improve the ESG disclosure system.", PurposeIn this study, we examine the influence of a firm\s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on analysts\ stock recommendations and earnings forecast accuracy in the Chinese context.Design/methodology/approachWe take a textual analysis approach to analyst research reports issued between 2010 and 2019, and differentiate between two distinct analyst categories: "sustainability analysts," which refer to those more inclined to incorporate ESG information into their analyses, and "other analysts."FindingsOur evidence indicates that sustainability analysts tend to be significantly more likely than others to provide positive stock recommendations and demonstrate enhanced accuracy in forecasting earnings for companies with superior ESG performance. Our additional analyses reveal that this finding is particularly prominent for analysts who graduated from institutions emphasizing the protection of the environment, those recognized as star analysts, those affiliated with ESG-oriented brokerages, and forecasts made by analysts in the later part of the sample period. Our findings further indicate that sustainability analysts exhibit a more pronounced negative response when confronted with a negative ESG event.Originality/valueIn general, the evidence from this study reveals the interplay between ESG factors and analyst behavior, offering valuable implications for both financial analysts and sustainable investment strategies.

Motivation: In the context of the growing importance of sustainability reporting, understanding the link between ESG and firm performance is critical for informed and sustainable corporate strategies. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study employs panel data regression techniques on secondary data from 120 Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed firms between 2015 and 2020. Main Findings: Overall, the composite ESG scores do not significantly affect the financial performance of South African companies. However, scores from social and governance pillars show a positive association with firm performance, while environmental scores have a limited effect. Practical Implications/Managerial Impact: These findings suggest that not all ESG activities are equally relevant for firm profitability. Corporate managers should prioritise industry-relevant ESG pillars to enhance firm profitability. Novelty/Contribution: The study expands empirical evidence in an emerging market context, analysing the impact of disaggregated ESG scores and providing comparative industry-specific analysis. This contributes to a nuanced understanding of the ESG-performance nexus., "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between a companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and its financial performance. This paper also investigates the relationship between ESG performance and a companys market valuation. This paper provides convincing empirical evidence that delivering superior ESG performance pays off financially. Design/methodology/approach The financial data and ESG scores of 150 publicly traded companies listed in the Standard and Poors 500 index for 2017-2020, comprising 5,750 observations, were collected. STATA was used to run a fixed-effect regression and a weighted least squares model to analyze the panel data. Findings The results of the empirical analysis suggest that companies with superior ESG performance perform better financially and are valued higher in the market compared to their industry peers. The ESG rating score impacts both return-on-capital-employed as a proxy for financial performance and Tobins Q as a proxy for the market valuation of a company. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing research on ESG performance and financial performance relationship by providing empirical evidence to resolve confusion in the existing literature caused by contradictory evidence. Taking advantage of worldwide crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this study shows that a positive relationship between ESG performance and a companys market valuation holds even during times of unexpected crises. Further, this study contributes to business practitioners knowledge by showing that ESG aspects constitute highly relevant non-financial information that impact the markets perception of a company and that investing in sustainability positively impacts a companys bottom line.", "Purpose This paper aims to investigate the effect of total and each individual component of environmental, social and governance score (ESG) on financial performance (FP) of healthcare companies. Design/methodology/approach Data for 468 health-care firms for the business year 2020 is sourced from Thomson Reuters to obtain ESG data. Correlation and multivariate regression analysis are done to investigate the relation between ESG activities and firm performance. The analysis has been done on overall data and subsample data to examine the relation across developing vs developed markets. Findings The results of the study suggest that relation between ESG score and FP cannot be generalized. The results show that performing ESG activities positively impact firm performance of healthcare companies in developed economies; however, this relationship would be negative or insignificant in the case of developing economies. Practical implications The results of this study have implications for both practitioners and policymakers. The authors suggest the specific setups in which the relationship between ESG activities and firm performance will be negative or insignificant. These results are beneficial to policymakers who seek to increase the active participation of firms in ESG activities. Originality/value To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to explore the relationship of ESG score on FP through the lens of country-level development variables for health-care sector companies."

A secondary dataset comprising 18,943 firms and 103,632 contractual links from the global automotive industry was employed to test the hypotheses. Publicly available ESG controversies data for 268 firms were gathered from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database. The results indicated a negative relationship between the interconnectedness of neighbours networks and their ESG controversies. The results further revealed a positive association between the centrality of a firms neighbours and their ESG controversies. Furthermore, the study highlighted that a firm occupying a bridging position positively moderates the relationship between neighbours interconnectedness and ESG controversies. Drawing on a real-world large-scale supply network, our study extends the emerging debate on the criticality of broader supply networks in firms sustainability by investigating the role of neighbours structural properties in firms ESG controversies.", The study investigates the impact of environment, social and governance (ESG) controversies on firm performance in India. Utilizing a sample of 1,024 firm-year observations of Indian firms from 2007 to 2018, the study reports that ESG controversies reduce firm performance. Further, after introducing the interaction effect of government effectiveness, the ESG controversies maintain a similar negative influence on performance. Additionally, the interaction effect of government effectiveness and ESG controversies negatively affects performance in response to ESG controversies. The study conducts a sample-split analysis that indicates the moderation effect of government effectiveness is significantly negative only in the post-CSR mandate period. This study is novel in analysing insights on government effectiveness moderation impact on firm performance in response to ESG controversies., This study examines the effect of corporate governance on the relationship between ESG controversies and firm value. Panel data consisting of 883 non-financial Chinese listed firms from 2018 to 2022 are analyzed. We find a significant and negative impact of ESG controversies on firm value. The presence of effective corporate governance is found to mitigate the negative impact of ESG controversies on firm value. The findings are robust to the two step GMM, 2SLS method and heteroskedasticity test. Then we explore the influence of internal governance factors and external corporate governance factors respectively. Among the internal factors, we find that board gender diversity, board independence, equity incentive, and high reputation VC/PE shareholdings all have a significant and positive impact, while board size and sustainability committees have no significant impact. In terms of external governance factors, ESG controversies in regions with fierce market competition have a relatively small impact on firm value, while those in regions with perfect legal environment have a more severe impact on firm value. Further analysis shows that environmental, social and governance controversies urge enterprises to improve their environmental and social performance and reduce inefficient investment respectively, and these effects are more pronounced in the corporate governance group with high level. However, governance controversies have no impact on accounting information quality. These findings have important policy implications for managers and practitioners by supporting the idea of companies adopting appropriate corporate governance practices that can effectively mitigate the negative effects of corporate controversies.

Most recent sample of 351 firms from FTSE350 for the time period 2002-2018 is used. The study estimates the impact of total ESG and individual dimensions of ESG on corporate financial performance using static and dynamic panel data techniques, and it also examines the impact of high and low ESG on firm financial performance. Further, the study investigates the role of firm size as a moderator in the relationship between ESG and firm financial performance. The results of total ESG performance indicate that ESG has a positive and significant impact on firm financial performance. However, in the case of the individual ESG performance, the results are mixed. Overall, the results confirm that high ESG firms show high financial performance as compared to low ESG firms. Results indicate that firm size moderates the relationship between ESG performance and firm financial performance., Nowadays, the stakeholders placed greater emphasized towards how businesses impact the economy, environment and society as a whole. Hence, befits the foundation towards the creations of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) parameters factors. The evolution of this holistic approach to business management, focussing on the ESG might influence firm\s financial performance. In light of these issues, motivated current study to scrutinize the influence of the ESG practices towards firm\s financial performance. The static panel data regression analysis was utilized for an unbalanced panel data for 69 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia spanning from the year 2009 to 2018. The postulated hypothesis used ESG scores as the indicators for the ESG practice among the public listed firms. While, the financial performance is measured using Return on invested capital (ROIC). The results suggest statistically significant negative relations between the ESG score and firm\s financial performance. The relationship dimensions support the long standing debates on the trade-off between benefits and the costs of doing "good". (C) 2020 Published by European Publisher., "This paper investigates the way in which environmental responsibility impacts on corporate financial performance, measured by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). Using a sample of Korean firms covering the period 2011-2012, and employing two different test methods, namely the OLS and 2SLS methods, we show that the relationships between environmental responsibility performance and firms ROE and ROA are positive and statistically significant. However, we show that research and development (R&D) intensity (expenditure) does not affect either environmental responsibility or corporate financial performance. The results of this analysis encourage further empirical analysis of the industries, as well as the use of more than one estimation method to determine environmental responsibility and corporate financial performance within firms.

The objective of this paper was to investigate the role of audit quality in improving ESG performance, as well as to examine the role of media coverage represented by ESG controversy score in moderating these relationships. We analyzed 303 Chinese companies with 2,121 observations covering the period from 2017 to 2023. The results suggest that the effects of audit quality as measured by the Big 4 and audit fee on improving ESG performance are positive but not significant. On the other hand, the results reveal that media coverage serves as a positive, albeit non-significant, moderating variable between audit quality measured by the Big 4 and ESG performance, while it has a significant negative effect when audit quality is evaluated based on audit fees. The results indicate that improving ESG performance is significantly linked to auditors intensifying their practices and implementing their work more stringently. More importantly, media coverage is an important additional driver and economic incentive that encourages companies to steer clear of poor ESG-related practices., Companies are under increasing pressure to manage their reputation on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Auditors are a potential source of ESG risk management expertise and assurance due to a deep understanding of their client\s ESG-related reputation risk ("ESG risk") and their assurance reporting expertise. However, provision of nonaudit services by the external auditor is controversial and public accountants are still defining their role in ESG risk control and reporting. We explore whether auditors help companies manage heightened ESG risk in times of reputation crisis, using abnormal negative ESG-related media coverage as a measure of "tainted reputation." Findings show a positive association between tainted reputation and nonaudit services and between the interaction of tainted reputation and nonaudit services with future firm value. The positive interaction persists when we consider a proxy for other ESG risk management activities in our analyses and for other measures of ESG risk management effectiveness (future stock returns and future tainted reputation). Subsample analyses indicate that results are driven by companies audited by ESG industry specialist auditors, that the association between tainted reputation and nonaudit services is driven by companies owned by institutional shareholders, and that inferences from our results may not hold when ESG risk is dominated by its social component. Using restatements as a proxy, we fmd no evidence to suggest that the interaction of tainted reputation and nonaudit services is associated with impaired audit quality. Findings demonstrate an empirical linkage between tainted reputation and nonaudit services that is positively associated with future firm value measures., "In recent years, investors have begun to value companies reputations through their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. ESG risk can affect business processes and controls and can heighten financial risk and threaten a firms survival. This study examines whether and how the severity of media coverage of a firms negative ESG issues (tainted ESG reputation) is associated with audit effort and audit quality. I find that auditors manage the higher expected engagement risk conveyed by tainted ESG reputation by applying higher audit effort. Next, I observe that the increased effort is associated with auditors likely detecting and requiring adjustments for material misstatements and that tainted ESG reputation is associated with fewer misstatements (i.e., reduces poor audit quality). The association between tainted ESG reputation and audit quality is driven primarily by increased audit report lag, not by increased audit fees. Further, I find that tainted ESG reputation is positively associated with audit effort and reduces poor audit quality for up to three years. The results also show that the audit effort and audit quality effect vary across the three components of ESG. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Achieving a performance advanatge while not causing destructive effects is the new challange. Consequently, considering the UNs sustainable development goals (SDGs), this study investigated how environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) could contribute to a better financial performance for multinational companies. Due to the ecological, economic, and social consequences of business (Mebratu, 1998) it has never been more important for society to lean towards sustainable practices (Brune, 2016). As new challenges emerge, new concepts of how to deal with them evolve, including the concept of sustainable development as a foundation to management thinking and descision making. Private businesses are a key component in acheiveing the UNs desired sustainable view, as they can help to fill the $3tn annual investment gap expected to be needed across the next 15 years (Earley, 2016). As a generation, millennials have a critical role to play in achieving a sustainable furture. Millennials are the next group of business thinkers and descisons makers. Based on research conducted by this study, eight out of ten London based millennials acknowledged the private sector has a critical role in helping to achieve a sustainable future for all. However, fewer than three in ten millennials actually believe that private businesses will take action, instead continuing to place their short-term profitability mindset ahead of sustainability (Tuffrey, 2016). With a world population of 50% under the age of 30 (WEF, 2017), and with millennials continuing to become more conscious of trends which affect the planet and their future, the expectation of businesses to act sustainably seems to be rising. This study confirmed a multitude of ways to increase business performance sustainably, such as driving sales by targeting consumers increasing willingness to pay a premium for sustainable goods. A questionnaire supported this approach by confirming that 9 out of 10 millennial Londoners acknowledged that action on climate-change should be the responsibility of both individuals and private businesses. However, a smaller amount, only 4 out of 10 millennials surveyed, were willing to contribute by shifting their purchasing-behaviour, to more sustainable products, if prices were higher. Further to this, if a product was found to be unethical, the data collected showed 75% of millennials would take action by looking for a competitor or leaning towards an alternative (30% of those surveyed). Consequently the results suggest millennials expect the private sector to step up and deliver sustainable products at competitive prices in order to truely help.", The subject of the study is the fiscal aspects of the ESG concept of business development. . Methodology. The study uses general scientific methods, in particular, theoretical generalisation, methods of analysis and synthesis and statistical analysis, as well as the graphical method to visualise the results of the study. The purpose of the study is to analyse the strategic guidelines of tax policy through the prism of the ESG concept. Conclusion. The fiscal aspects of the ESG concept are an important element in understanding its impact on business. They include various tax incentives and mechanisms that promote the implementation of ESG standards and take into account the consequences of non-compliance for businesses. In particular, fiscal policy includes tax incentives for businesses that invest in green development, support social initiatives or improve corporate governance. In a broad sense, instruments such as environmental taxes are aimed at achieving sustainable growth and economic development. Strategic tax policy guidelines under the ESG approach include encouraging investment in sustainable technologies through tax incentives for companies investing in renewable energy and environmentally friendly projects. Social initiatives are supported through tax rebates for companies that develop programmes to develop local communities and improve working conditions. Corporate governance regulations require companies to report on the environmental, social and governance aspects of their activities. Promoting the circular economy includes tax incentives for companies that implement recycling and waste reduction practices. Support for small and medium-sized businesses includes tax incentives for SMEs that implement ESG standards and easier access to green finance. International cooperation involves bringing tax policy in line with international ESG standards and participating in global tax transparency initiatives. Adaptation to climate change includes the introduction of taxes on greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to low-carbon business models. Green project financing involves the use of tax revenues to support green initiatives. Innovations in tax administration are being introduced through new technologies, and education and training include funding for ESG training programmes. These guidelines will help businesses adapt to new conditions, create sustainable value and meet modern environmental, social and governance requirements., "Due to the ecological, economic, and social consequences of business (Mebratu, 1998) it has never been more important for society to lean towards sustainable practices (Brune, 2016). As new challenges emerge, new concepts of how to deal with them evolve, including the concept of sustainable development as a foundation to management thinking and decision making. Private businesses are a key component in achieving the UNs desired sustainable view, as they can help to fill the $3tn annual investment gap expected to be needed across the next 15 years (Earley, 2016). It is possible for business to change and grow sustainably. Various multinational companies paved the way to active sustainable practices setting the example for other companies to follow. Considering the UNs sustainable development goals (SDGs), this study investigated how environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) could contribute to a better financial performance for multinational companies. In order to investigate the effects of sustainable practices on performance, various sources of academic research and quantitative data was necessary. A holistic approach was adopted, permitting the discovery of internal and external factors critical for the topic investigated. Six multinational firms with a market cap of over 500 million were analysed on their publicly reported financials, half of which from the lowest position in the sustainability ranks. The study takes into consideration ESG performance measurement to assess the level of correlation with positive or negative financial results. The research conveys data of Ikea, Unilever, Starbucks, LG, Fast Retailing and ConAgra stock price, revenue, market capitalisation and the year-on-year fluctuation of those variables in the last decade. The three key findings strongly align with the developing theory of sustainable development as a strategic approach to grow business value over time. (Brune, 2016) The first finding suggests that unsustainable companies are subject to higher volatility in their growth-rate. As per Hemert (2014), this can be for a number of reasons, the main one being their resilience in case of unexpected macro events. The second finding is the lack of stock price re-appreciation for unsustainable companies when those events are negative for the business growth. It is however a combination of variables that driver stocks prices, sustainability being just one of them. (Yadav et al., 2015) Lastly, on the negative stock price year on year percentage change, the third finding emerged: the unsustainable practices analysed experienced steeper and more frequent share price change compared to sustainable ones (over the same decade). No market has ever taken off when fundamentals dont make sense to investors hence an analysis of companies financial performance (within and outside ESG) was completed to measure sustainability advantages/disadvantages, supporting an array of applicable recommendations for companies to tackle the strategic short and long term sustainability development."]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

By disclosing relevant data and insights, sustainability reports enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, understand companies environmental and social impacts, and assess their long-term sustainability strategies. This paper examines the evolving landscape of corporate sustainability reporting in Bulgaria, taking into account the broader context of corporate impact assessment and impact accounting. The study begins with an introduction to the growing importance of sustainability reporting in todays business environment, emphasising the need for transparency, accountability and compliance. A review of the current literature on the subject reveals a notable trend towards increased disclosure of environmental initiatives and impacts, alongside persistent challenges such as inadequate quality and quantity of reporting, expertise gaps and inconsistencies in guidance. To address these issues, the research uses a mixed-methods approach to explore the nature of sustainability reporting, regulatory frameworks and accountability practices in Bulgarian companies. Through data analysis and interpretation of findings, the study reveals a positive trend towards greater disclosure of sustainability initiatives and impacts, albeit with significant variations in reporting quality and methodology. As Bulgarian companies prepare for the implementation of the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD), the study highlights the essential need to align with evolving sustainability reporting standards to promote transparency and accountability. By addressing these challenges, companies can better meet stakeholder expectations, contribute to sustainable development goals, and build reputation and trust in the corporate sector. Finally, this paper contributes to the field of sustainability reporting by providing valuable insights into the current state of affairs in Bulgarian companies.", There exists a huge difference in sustainability reporting adoption & implementation within and between countries which affect achievement of desired results at global level for environmental protection and social development. This study summarises and analyses 133 studies of sustainability reporting published between year 2004 and 2022 in web of sciences (WoS) database through Bibliometric Analysis and also used Theory, Context, Characteristic Methodology framework to represent the state of research in this field for the first time. The study is divided in two sections (1) develop an understanding on sustainability reporting trends and thematic evolution, and (2) discussion on challenges of sustainability reporting adoption and implementation. The present study consolidates the state of research on sustainability reporting. The study finds a thematic shift since 2017 onwards and a significant increase in publications since 2018. It identifies four major thematic clusters namely, sustainability reporting, board gender diversity, content analysis, and ESG disclosure which reveals that ESG reporting, ESG disclosures, and sustainability stakeholder impact assessment has high potential for future research. It also contributes by identifying most prominent theories in the field viz stakeholder, legitimacy and institutional theory and preferred methodology as qualitative research. It finds emerging themes as Sustainability Reporting Quality, ESG disclosure, cross-country evaluation and also highlights most relevant keywords and trends in the research field. Study recognises lack of common definition and conceptual understanding, standards measurement metrics and cross-country evaluations as major challenges which stands as big problem at policy formation and implementation stage., The challenge of sustainability lies in achieving a balance between satisfying present needs and protecting resources for future generations with an emphasis on its three pillars-environmental, social and governance. This study explored sustainable development encompassing environmental, social and governance aspects along with sustainability reporting through various sustainability frameworks. A systematic review of literature for the period 2010-23 on major worldwide sustainability frameworks was conducted, by offering insights into enhancing reporting mechanisms for a sustainable future. Secondary data related to sustainability reports were obtained from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and International Integrated Reporting Council, which helped in examining sector and year variations across countries. The results reflected that mandatory sustainability disclosures help to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and global sustainability frameworks help to set standards, disseminate information and promote transparency. Collaboration of investment, company action and sustainability organizations can lead to a sustainable global economy. The adoption of sustainability reporting can help organizations by fostering a proper understanding of sustainability practices, improving transparency and identifying potential business opportunities in sectors with lower sustainability. The paper provided insights into sustainability reporting published across various countries in both advanced as well as emerging and developing economies. The analysis showed which sectors and time periods have had the most sustainability reports and which areas needed to be targeted for action to advance sustainable development. This study examines sustainability reporting methods by looking at frameworks and reports from 2010-2023. Researchers analyse data from sustainability organizations to understand how reporting can improve transparency and align with global goals.

Utilizing the performance analysis and science mapping techniques which includes citation analysis, co-word analysis, the study reports a holistic overview of 693 (ESG) papers from 1991 to 2020. The paper aims to provide a unified perspective on the evolution and further identify future research directions in this field. The findings point to the most important countries, authors, studies, and top journals in this field. Results show that published articles on ESG gained momentum after 2006; however, an exponential rise is being observed in the past 5 years, with research focusing on sustainable finance, sustainable development, ESG, and CSR with themes extending to risk management, stakeholder engagement, and portfolio construction, among others. Furthermore, the research identifies how the practice of ESG reporting affects many variables such as financial performance, social performance, environmental performance, and sustainability score. The findings also indicate that the field of ESG is still evolving, with numerous unexplored themes. The work is novel and relevant on the pretext that it uses the Scopus and Web of Science databases for bibliometric mapping, whereas previous studies have used the Scopus database but have lacked a robust methodology, so the findings of this study provided strong support for identifying emerging paradigms in the ESG literature., Purpose This study aimed to quantify and map academic literature of ESG from a bibliometric perspective and to provide a comprehensive review of the recent literature published in the high-rated journal articles.Design/methodology/approach The study analyzed 867 and 388 documents from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) data respectively using bibliometric analysis. Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software was used for performance analysis and science mapping respectively. Further, manual content analysis of the 190 research articles published in the last five years was conducted.Findings The results demonstrate that ESG is an emerging domain in the field of sustainable finance as the number of publications and total citations are showing an upward trend. The top two journals in terms of productivity are the Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment and Business Strategy and the Environment. The highest number of publications are from the United States and George Serafeim is the most influential author in the ESG domain. Further, the result of cluster analysis of bibliographic coupling reveals four intellectual themes, (1) ESG investing; (2) ESG disclosures and Integrated Reporting; (3) ESG performance and firm value and (4) Corporate Governance and ESG performance. The content analysis of the 190 high-quality journal articles presents the current 11 areas of research in ESG. The impact of ESG on firm value and ESG investment are the prominent themes, and the effect of ESG on the cost of capital and ESG audit and assurance are the emerging themes in this domain.Research limitations/implications The keyword search is solely focusing on the theme of the study. Further, other keywords such as Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate sustainability taken along with ESG may provide distinct results.Practical implications The study advances the understanding of the ESG domain by developing new possibilities to discover key research areas.Originality/value The present work provides a comprehensive and detailed bibliometric and content analysis of ESG literature. This study delineates the thorough literature review of journal articles published in the recent five years in high-rated journals., "Purpose-This study aims to holistically present a systematic literature review (SLR) triangulated with bibliometric analysis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) research to synthesize and comprehensively review its evolving journey and emerging research streams. Design/methodology/approach-Using R-studio software, this study carried out a retrospective quantitative bibliometric analysis through performance analysis, science mapping and network analysis, covering 261 documents published on ESG research between 2007 and 2022 in Scopus and Web of Science databases. Findings- Performance analysis depicts the trends in publications, impactful journals and influential publications, authors and countries, while science mapping incorporates co-words and thematic analysis. Likewise, co-occurrence analysis provided four different clusters, representing ESG research linkage to other management fields along with key insights from co-citation network analysis. Additionally, the theory-context-characteristics-methods (TCCM) framework has provided valuable results in terms of widely and emerging used theories, contexts, characteristics and methodologies in ESG research. Research limitations/implications-The findings of this studys comprehensive bibliometric analysis combined with SLR uncovered a robust roadmap for further investigation in ESG research by identifying the inherent structure and evolution of research themes. This review has not only identified the prevalent gaps in determining priorities for future research but also provides insights which not previously been captured and evaluated on this topic. Originality/value-To the best of the authors knowledge, no study presents the TCCM framework in the context of bibliometric analysis of ESG research. Besides, a conceptual framework is developed that illustrates antecedents, mediators, moderators and outcomes of research on ESG practices and provides the concluded key takeaways and recommendations for potential authors intending to publish their research papers on ESG practices."

Currently, traditional evaluation methods have limitations such as low efficiency and lack of objectivity. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of ESG evaluation and promote the optimization of ESG performance in manufacturing enterprises, this article combined data mining and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to conduct effective research on ESG management practice evaluation in manufacturing enterprises. This article adopted the best priority search strategy to collect and process enterprise ESG data. By using AHP to construct hierarchical and segmented objectives for target problems, a performance evaluation index system for management practices was built based on the evaluation objectives and hierarchical priority order. Finally, based on the performance evaluation of ESG management practices, the K-nearest Neighbor algorithm was applied to analyze historical data of key indicators. According to the weights, various key indicators were re-integrated, achieving practical evaluation and decision support for enterprise ESG management. To verify the effectiveness of data mining and AHP, this article took Z enterprise as the research object and conducted empirical analysis on it. The results showed that in terms of evaluation accuracy, the method proposed in this article achieved the highest evaluation accuracy of 92.51%, 91.16%, and 91.75% in environmental, social, and governance dimension data use case evaluation, respectively. The conclusion indicated that data mining and AHP could improve the accuracy of ESG management practice evaluation in enterprises, provide reliable decision support for enterprise development, and help promote sustainable development of enterprises., At present, coal enterprises generally have inadequate environmental protection, serious social issues, and poor corporate governance. Against the background of sustainable development strategies and the "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality" targets, there is an urgent need to conduct a performance evaluation of the sustainable development of coal enterprises. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance is the foundation and booster of sustainable and high-quality development of coal enterprises. It is a typical application of sustainable development and performance evaluation theory to carry out ESG-led performance evaluation and case research of coal enterprises. Therefore, in this paper, we construct the model framework of ESG-grounded theory-entropy method-cloud model to research the performance evaluation of coal enterprises under the guidance of sustainable development from the dimensions of theoretical optimization and case analysis. The model framework includes the factor structure model, performance evaluation index system, index weighting model, and performance evaluation model. First, on the basis of the theory of ESG and triple bottom line, the finance-environment-society-governance (FESG) structural dimension model of coal enterprise performance evaluation was extracted through the three-level coding of grounded theory (GT). On this basis, the performance evaluation index system from the perspective of sustainable development was constructed. Second, on the basis of the entropy method (EM), the weight model of the coal enterprise performance evaluation index was constructed to determine the weight of indexes at all levels. Third, the performance evaluation model was constructed on the basis of the cloud model (CM), and the principles and methods of "dividing index grade, normalizing index grade, calculating index grade membership degree, and evaluating enterprise performance grade" were clarified. Fourth, in order to verify the feasibility of the model framework, a typical listed company (enterprise Z) in the coal industry was selected in order to conduct a case research based on the statistical data from 2016 to 2020 and analyze the performance grade evaluation results. The research shows that (1) the FESG structural dimension model extracted by grounded theory analysis method and the performance evaluation index system of coal enterprises oriented by sustainable development enrich the connotation and extension of ESG theory; (2) the index weighting model based on the entropy method can objectively determine the weight of indicators at all levels of each dimension of performance; (3) the construction path of coal enterprise performance evaluation model based on cloud model can be used to construct performance evaluation models for other industries; (4) the model framework based on the ESG-grounded theory-entropy method-cloud model can be used to reasonably measure the performance level of coal enterprises and provide theoretical support for the research of performance evaluation inside and outside the industry; (5) the sustainable development performance of coal enterprises is the basis and guarantee for achieving sustainable and high-quality development. The research results can provide theoretical reference for the regulatory authorities to formulate performance evaluation policies from the perspective of sustainable development., The high-quality development of energy is the basis for and premise of achieving the high-quality development of the economy, and energy enterprises, as the main body of the microeconomy, are the "carrier" of its success. The national strategy of dual carbon and energy security requires energy enterprises to achieve sustainable development. In the context of global sustainable development, ESG is an evaluation technology that comprehensively measures the environmental sustainability, social value and governance ability of enterprises and improves the sustainable development ability of enterprises by focusing on the non-financial performance of enterprises and the co-creation and sharing of stakeholder value. As an important energy producer and consumer, China has not yet established an ESG evaluation system for energy enterprises that is in line with international standards and national conditions. Therefore, this paper constructs an ESG evaluation model framework of energy enterprises and studies the high-quality development performance evaluation of energy enterprises under the sustainable development strategy from the two dimensions of theoretical enrichment and empirical analysis. The model framework includes a factor structure model, performance evaluation index system, index weight model and performance evaluation model. First, integrating the new development concept and the safe development concept, the ESG connotation of China\s energy enterprises was defined by localization. Second, using the Delphi method, an ESG evaluation system with 3 sub-target layers, 14 criteria layers and 40 index layers was constructed. Third, the weights of each index in the ESG evaluation system were established by using an AHP-entropy combination weighting method. Fourth, based on the statistical data of 2021, 79 key pollutant energy enterprises listed in China were selected. The TOPSIS method was used to establish an evaluation model to empirically evaluate the comprehensive level of ESG and the performance of the E, S and G dimensions of the sample companies, and the evaluation results were analyzed. The results show that the weight ratio of E, S and G is relatively balanced; and the weight of social responsibility ranks first at the target level, environmental response ranks first at the criterion level and energy supply guarantee ranks first at the index level. The overall ESG performance of the sample companies is average, and the G performance is not ideal. The ESG synthesis and the performance of all dimensions are significantly polarized, and the development of different dimensions of E, S and G is mostly unbalanced and uncoordinated. The results demonstrate the following: (1) Using the Delphi method, the ESG structural dimension model of energy enterprises is constructed by selecting evaluation indicators reflecting the concepts of innovation, coordination, green, open, sharing and safety, which enriches the connotation and extension theory of ESG. (2) The AHP-entropy combination weighting method model can scientifically obtain the weights of indicators at each level in the ESG evaluation system. (3) The proposed ESG evaluation index system can effectively measure the high-quality development level of energy enterprises. This research can provide regulatory authorities with sustainable development policy suggestions for strengthening the top-level design of ESG; building an ESG-healthy ecosystem; and integrating ESG investment with energy security, carbon-neutral goals and corporate strategies to promote the high-quality development of enterprises.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved., Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies, acting as relevant financial market actors, should take a stand on working towards achieving a more sustainable development. In this context, the objective of this paper is, on the one hand, to understand how criteria used by ESG rating agencies in their assessment processes have evolved over the last ten years and, on the other hand, to analyze whether ESG rating agencies are contributing to fostering sustainable development by the inclusion of sustainability principles into their assessment processes and practices according to the ESG criteria. This research is based on a comparative descriptive analysis of the public information provided by the most representative ESG rating and information provider agencies in the financial market in two periods: 2008 and 2018. The findings show that ESG rating agencies have integrated new criteria into their assessment models to measure corporate performance more accurately and robustly in order to respond to new global challenges. However, a deep analysis of the criteria also shows that ESG rating agencies do not fully integrate sustainability principles into the corporate sustainability assessment process., Purpose - The aim of this study is to propose a method to measure the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) identity (Otubanjo, 2013) of a firm. Using this method, based on a fuzzy logic expert system, it is possible to generate a comprehensive rating for the assessment of the sustainability of a firm. In fact, to ensure that a firm is CSR-compliant, it is important to express CSR principles in terms of measurable variables. Up to now, measurement has been hampered by a lack of clarity in theoretical frameworks and empirical methods for the CSR construct. Design/methodology/approach- The analysis model is formalized through an FES (fuzzy expert system). The algorithm of the FES aggregates multicriteria evaluations of a problem. The assessments of behaviour and the resulting decisions are represented in blocks of rules, drawn up by an inference engine in fuzzy logic. The FES unites the ability of an expert system to simulate the decision-making process with the uncertainty typical of human reasoning, which is present in fuzzy logic. The main structure of the model is based on the aggregation of three components: human capital (HumanCap), strategy (Strategy) and reporting (ESGrep: Environmental, Social and Governance reporting). Originality/value - Despite the spread of CSR practices among firms, there is not a commonly accepted method of measuring sustainability. Moreover, although Environmental social governance (ESG) rating agencies provide CSR ratings, their methodologies have certain weaknesses. Considering the growing importance of socially responsible financial markets, this topic may prove to be of vital importance, above all for decision-makers in the management of their investments, by remedying the deficiencies in methodologies used by sustainability rating organizations. We also think that fuzzy logic methodology is an appropriate way of assessing sustainability because of the "fuzzy" nature of sustainability. Practical implications - The outcome of the application is a system designed to measure the CSR identity of a firm. On the management side, the possibility to identify the determinants of the different CSR intermediate indicators making up the final CSR index would allow CSR-compliant managers to use this

This paper aims to document the prevalence of green building reporting in public firms, assess how well firms apply good practices of green building and show which firms, countries and industry sectors are particularly advanced in the application of green building technologies. Design/methodology/approach The study uses data on green building reporting, green building scores and firm characteristics of 1,281 publicly traded firms from different industries in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over a 5-year period. Regression analysis is used to relate the adoption of green building reporting and excellence in green building to firm characteristics. Findings The results indicate that there is a huge variation in green building activities and reporting in corporate real estate management across countries and industries. The study finds that firms in the financial and health-care sectors are leading in green building reporting. Environmental, social and corporate governance-oriented, profitable and large firms receive the highest green building scores. Research limitations/implications The results in this paper rely on the reported but not inevitably monitored green building activities. There may also be companies that use green building technologies but do not report on them. The conclusions are largely based on correlations and do not allow for causal statements (endogenous variables). Practical implications The results in this paper are crucial for practitioners in corporate real estate to benchmark their green building activities and reporting. Additionally, the paper sheds light on how information on green building is propagated in the financial market. Originality/value The paper looks at the drivers and barriers of green building for 25 countries and across all industry sectors (1,281 firms). In contrast to that most of the existing literature focuses on single countries and limits the analysis to companies in the real estate and construction industry. Additionally, the paper has a joint focus on publicly available green building reporting and green building scores., Corporations develop, own, operate, and direct a majority of all assets in the built environment (BE), and the development and operation of these assets is a significant component of global sustainability. In recent years corporate sustainability action for large companies has trended toward becoming embedded within corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) programs. However, ESG strategies and their impacts are only beginning to be understood by large corporations, with little definition for how to apply, measure, and assess the effectiveness of ESG practices. Every industry sector has some connection to the BE, and construction engineering, and management (CEM) professionals contribute to all phases of the BE life cycle, including development, design, construction, and operations. As such, CEM professionals are vital in developing and implementing sustainability practices specifically for corporations with large footprints in the BE. The purpose of this research was to assess the extent to which the BE is impacted by corporate sustainability practice through ESG programs. The research utilized a grounded theory approach to explore sustainability practices directly associated with the BE from companies within all 11 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors. It presents a representative model that encapsulates current organizational ESG strategy, through the development of ESG action categories. A total of 24 different ESG action categories are presented and defined. The research further identifies those ESG actions commonly applied by large corporations and how these actions differ by GICS sector. This research indicates that over half of corporate ESG actions are related to the BE. Ultimately, this paper demonstrates the necessary role that CEM professionals should play in influencing sustainability practice through ESG strategy and action within the BE. ESG is a rising topic in corporate sustainability and is becoming increasingly tied to financial instruments such as sustainable investment indexes or green bonds. The rise of ESG presents both a challenge and an opportunity for CEM professionals. Large entities are expected to publish ESG reports sharing their sustainability progress, including entities in which CEM professionals are key figures, such as power utilities. The advent of ESG reporting presents a challenge to CEM professionals because they need to learn to navigate ESG reporting or risk losing access to valuable funding opportunities when subject to ESG measurement and evaluation. It also presents an opportunity for CEM professionals because they are uniquely qualified to lead ESG efforts as BE experts. ESG and the BE are strongly related, with most ESG work being environmental in nature. CEM professionals have been actively involved in improving the sustainability of BE assets as they relate to the environment for many years. To leverage this experience, CEM professionals need to take an active part in recommending improvements to corporate ESG strategy. Corporations themselves must also actively seek to engage CEM professionals in their ESG decision making processes and advisory boards., Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly becoming imperative and obligatory across various industries. The ESG performance within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is under heightened market scrutiny. However, current ESG management in construction is still in its infancy due to two limitations: (1) a deficiency in ESG knowledge, such as indicators pertinent to construction activities, and (2) a lack of data security in ESG management, culminating in inefficient and unreliable environmental management practices. Therefore, this paper employs the Design Science Research Method (DSRM) to introduce a Blockchain-ESG Integrated (BESGI) framework, facilitating traceable ESG data management within construction projects. This framework presents three significant contributions. First, it identifies ten AEC-ESG indicators by analyzing ESG methods. Second, it proposes a mapping approach for AEC-ESG indicators to construction projects for key ESG information access and data source identification. Third, it develops a blockchainbased data management mechanism for traceable ESG data management in the BESGI framework. It validates and evaluates the framework in a construction project in Hong Kong. The results show that the framework is usable and can save labor costs by 20.15 % compared to traditional ESG management. This study offers a secure data management solution for ESG analysis of construction projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The use of project management at the municipal level in the implementation of urban development strategies has the following advantages: high flexibility in the formation of a list of projects; ability to choose forms, methods, resources and participants in the implementation of projects; harmonizing interests, organizing constructive dialogue and pooling the resources of various social groups (government, business, society), etc. In this regard, the aim of the work is to investigate the use of project management in the activities of public authorities and its development to achieve the goals of socio-economic development of territories. We consider major theoretical approaches to project management and present a general outline of the system of levels and tools related to the strategic management of territorys development. We analyze the experience of project management in Vologda and prove the effectiveness of its use in the implementation of territorys development strategy. In addition, we propose main directions for the application of advanced management technologies - the implementation of project management based on ESG principles. It includes addressing environmental issues (E - environmental), social responsibility (S - social) and personnel governance (G - governance). Analyzing theoretical foundations and Russian experience, we identify directions for the development of project management based on ESG principles, reveal current problems and propose a set of measures for further improvement of project work in the field of public administration in order to address strategic tasks of territorial development. The information base includes the works of Russian and foreign scientists, project management specialists, and data from official websites of Russias constituent entities. We use the following methods: analysis, comparison, generalization, sampling and grouping. The scientific provisions set out in the article may be useful to government officials and researchers interested in the implementation and application of project management.", "The study highlights that ESG factors importance varies by industry, and a more industry-specific approach is necessary to accurately assess companies ESG performance.

By examining the importance of various sustainability factors across different industries, the study highlights the need for more tailored ESG assessments. The findings have practical implications for rating agencies, companies, and investors interested in sustainable development. Based on the analysis, aggregated conclusions are given on the level of significance of various factors of sustainable development for specific industries. The studys findings suggest that its necessary to develop methodology of weights assessment for different industries, including the unified system of assessment across different ESG rating providers. In the beginning of 2023 Bank of Russia published the report, which provides recommendations on developing ESG assessment methodology and scope for the weights for each ESG criteria and elements. However there the lack of published of non-financial statements and reports, which enable to generate enough industrial statistics, complicates the process of developing weight coefficients for

Small- and medium-sized businesses/enterprises (SMBs/SMEs) have significant effects on the European economy. However, because of a lot of restriction factors, like business risk, the high expenses of data collection and management, and the lack of resources, sustainability reporting is considered a superfluous and burdensome activity for them. The aim of this research is to propose an automated, comprehensive and simplified system for the sustainability assessment of SMEs. This system is achieved by implementing three main phases. The first phase includes key performance indicators design, which starts with the identification of various key performance indicators for comprehensive sustainability assessment, and ends with proposing an optimal set of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that can encompass long-term issues and be applicable to SMEs in the EU. The second phase involves a new comprehensive method of sustainability assessment for all KPIs designed in the first phase. Therefore, a multi-criteria model, which involves four main pillars of sustainability assessment (economic, environmental, social and governance), is proposed. It gives different enterprises the ability to verify and compare their efficiency and sustainability with other companies within the same sector in an almost automated manner. In the final phase, a simple and an automated information system (WEBRIS), which provides a suitable environment for SME sustainability reporting, is developed. Finally, this system is verified in a case study of the Czech breweries sector.", "The report is targeted at key environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) indicators of performance. The performance indicators ESG are becoming more and more important for complex assessment of a company and of unified Sustainable Reporting. The development of key performance indicators is under development in many international institutions, e.g. UNEP, EFFAS, DVFA, CFA etc. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. There is growing evidence that suggests that ESG factors, when integrated into investment analysis and decision making, may offer investors potential long-term performance advantages. The aim of this paper is to introduce and give theoretical possibilities of establishing ESG key performance indicators at the corporate level to support investors decisions and to be a part of Sustainable Reporting. On the basis of theoretical knowledge was made an empirical analysis in small and medium enterprises at the Czech Republic in selected sectors with a focus on the ESG performance indicators and Sustainable Reporting.", This article is focused on modelling of performance indicators for corporate governance, which are designed to measure the performance of a company along with environmental and social (ESG) indicators. The ESG indicators thus become important performance benchmarks for investors in the European Union and other parts of the world. Performance indicators in the Czech manufacturing industry were researched in Project No. P403/11/2085 "Construction of Methods for Multi-Factorial Assessment of Company Complex Performance in Selected Sectors" at the Faculty of Business and Management, Brno University of Technology (BUT FBM), funded by Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (GACR). The article intends to propose performance indicators of corporate governance suitable for companies in manufacturing industries per CZ-NACE. These performance indicators of corporate governance are the result of an extensive review and a theoretical assessment of numerous literary sources, various materials of international organizations (such as GRI, UNCTAD, IFAC, IFRS, EFFAS-DVFA, CFA), OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, and EU Green Paper, the essence of which was incorporated into the questionnaires used in the survey. Seventy-nine companies were selected from the compiled data base and personally contacted. These were legal enterprises with more than 250 employees by the EU criteria. Selection of significant indicators proceeded from the inlet database, analysed and verified by cluster analysis. The objective of cluster analysis working with all initial input indicators, obtained by the analysis of available expert sources and empirical research, was the identification of particularities of variables, having any impact on the results of other methods of subsequent research stages. Selection of significant indicators for reviewed industry from the input database was the aim. The purpose was not to substitute identified database, but to establish an alternative file of appropriate variables. The objective of further data processing was the reduction of original broad file of indicators, namely by expert analysis and subsequent decision made by the team of authors, representing the input for subsequent application of multi-dimensional statistical method. The factor analysis yielded four categories of corporate governance measurement areas: 1) Monitoring and Reporting 2) CG Effectiveness 3) CG Structure 4) Compliance. The company itself should select its key Corporate Governance indicators on the basis of their significance and from the point of its strategy. These performance indicators should facilitate the companies to prove the progress towards sustainability objectives and to guarantee their environmental, social and economic impact coverage. The application of key performance indicators in a particular organizational context can be demanding. The understanding of their application and most appropriate implementation into the internal management shall be necessary prior to company\s decision regarding the measures of key performance indicators.

This article contributes to the development of research based on stakeholders theory in universities (Miller et al., 2014), taking into account the perception of the main group of university stakeholders, i.e. students, towards sustainable university. The research objective is to empirically verify perceptions and compare the level of implementation of the sustainable university concept among students of Bialystok University of Technology. In the theoretical part, a systematic literature review was conducted. The most frequent keywords related to the topic of sustainable university were also extracted as a part of the bibliometric analysis using the VOSviewer software. In the empirical part, descriptive statistics and difference tests (U-Man Whitney) were used to identify statistically significant differences between different groups of students in terms of perception of the sustainable university concept. In light of the research conducted, it can be concluded that Bialystok University of Technology is making efforts in various areas of sustainable development. However, there are specific areas where improvements can be made, such as enhancing awareness among students about the universitys sustainable development strategy, promoting critical thinking, and addressing uncertainties about certain campus activities and management policies. In the article, a new scale was developed to examine students perceptions of a sustainable university. It includes 30 items, is based on the areas of sustainable development of universities discussed in previous studies, and takes into account new criteria, in particular, those related to ESG factors.", The Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ARACIS) has begun its activity in 2005, as an autonomous public institution of national interest. Since then, it has developed many quality standards for the Romanian Higher Education (RHE) system. The ARACIS\ strategy relies on its assumed mission to constantly assure and improve quality in the Romanian universities, by following its declared objectives, such as: improving the external evaluation methodology, in full compliance with the European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance (ESG); increasing the role of students and employers, as final beneficiaries, within the process of evaluation and assurance of education quality; creating a quality culture in the RHE; establishing a permanent partnership with all institutions in the RHE system, as well as with the economic-social environment, in order to correlate the RHE with the labour market. ARACIS is carrying out its activity according to the best international practices, focusing towards quality assurance and evaluation of the RHE, as part of the European Higher Education Area. ARACIS pursues the external evaluation of the RHE institutions based on its methodology, concluded in six "Quality evaluation activities guide for university study programs and for higher education institutions". From this perspective, the paper presents the way in which the University of Oradea has adopted and implemented the Part V and VI of the ARACIS "External evaluation methodology, standards, reference standards and list of performance indicators" into its BL (DLS and RFE) study programs, focusing on describing the internal procedures and research methods used to measure the students\ satisfaction with these programs, as well as the way in which these internal procedures have been implemented within the University of Oradea in the last couple of years and which are the results so far. For this purpose, over 2800 questionnaires applied to all BL (DLS and RFE) students of the University of Oradea in these years will be described and interpreted, and their results will be used to formulate the conclusions of the paper, for assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the students\ experience and satisfaction in such of an environment., "In order to manage the worrying predicament of declining global birth rates, a majority of higher-education institutions have commenced to institute a series of diversified strategies in order to make higher-education sustainability count. The aim of this research is to present the results of a study with the goal of helping educational institutions achieve their sustainability. As a succession of quantitative and qualitative analyses and measurements, there are four valuable and contributive findings in this research. First, total tuition and miscellaneous revenues (TTMR), total university-industry cooperative revenues (TUCIR) and total grants from government (TGG) of higher-education governance (HEG) were able to directly and effectively increase higher-education sustainable value. This definitively indicates that current higher-education students and staff, as well as higher-education experts and professionals, indeed agree that the tuition and miscellaneous fees, university-industry cooperative, and government grant revenues have become the most critical determinants of university environment social governance (UESG). This is because the majority of higher-education institutions do need these revenue resources to advance a succession of environmental protections, social responsibilities, and governance performance for current higher-education institution sustainability development. Second, comprehensive scale of QS rankings (CS-QS) was the most important key determinant to evaluate the university social responsibility development (USRD), which means the majority of higher-education institutions have to pay more attention on the comprehensive scale of QS rankings (CS-QS) in order to make more sustainability count. The third finding is the number of students publications (NSP), which was the most crucial key determinant to assay return on investments (ROI), meaning current higher-education students, staff, experts, and professionals consent to higher-education institutions having to establish an evaluated system for students publications to stimulate students to publish their diversified studying outcomes in order to make students recognize their growth after taking courses in higher education. The last finding is total tuition and miscellaneous revenues (TTMR) was the most momentous key determinant to control high education governance (HEG), which means current higher-education students, staff, experts, and professionals are concerned with the various governance performances of their tuition and miscellaneous fees. As for the future direction, there are still some evaluated criteria and assessed methods to be comprehensively considered and employed for inducing in-depth conclusions and findings with higher research reliability and validity without time limitations and resource restrictions."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

B Corporations aim to generate a positive impact, and by seeking certification that validates this premise, they are evaluated in aspects of governance, environment, customers, community, and workers. Such assessment demonstrates attention to various stakeholders and can promote good practices. This research aims to analyse how the circular economy is being internalised in Brazilian B Corps from the perspective of Stakeholder Theory. A total of 264 Brazilian B Corporations were identified, which constitute the units of analysis for the case study. Seventy-six of these responded to questionnaires, and 12 B Corps participated in semi-structured interviews. The results suggest that: (i) circular economy actions through the ReSOLVE framework are partially implemented by B Corps; (ii) circular economy practices require engagement with stakeholders, especially for the share and cycle actions of the ReSOLVE framework that mainly involve customers and the community; (iii) government and consumers were identified as key stakeholders for accelerating the circular economy. The contributions of this study include: (i) presentation of a typology that brings together exploratory theoretical propositions about strategic stakeholders, circular economy assumptions, and business models of B Corps; (ii) correlation between the ReSOLVE framework, B Impact Assessment, and stakeholder theory; (iii) identification of key stakeholders for accelerating the transition to the circular economy. For future studies, it is suggested to further investigate organisations with a high percentage of adoption of ReSOLVE framework actions to identify how stakeholders engage in environmental best practices., PurposeThe paper aims to explore the model of circular economy for promotion of principles of social inclusion, empathetic governance, and economic sustainability environmental resilience by examining the research gap on how to employ Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) framework, principles of biomimicry and reimagining an economic model of resourcefulness.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is a descriptive study based on review of literature. To analyse the research gaps, paper employs bibliometric research technique, well-accepted meta-analytical research of literature to find overlapping factors of relevance by examining most-cited authors, papers, as well as co-citation patterns (Kim, 2008). The method analyses the published data texts, information like authorship, citations, keywords, and illustrating linkages between and among articles about certain research topic (Fetscherin, 2012).FindingsData were sourced from collection archival database of JSTOR, Web of Science and J-Gate till December 2022, by searching with following string - "Circular Economy," "ESG (Environment, Social and Governance)," "Biomimicry," "Circular Economy and ESG," "Circular Economy and Biomimicry," "Circular Economy and Resourcefulness." The selection of said string of words was based on the literature review, overlaps and the research questions formulated. The findings reflect common factors of overlaps and its coherence in domain of policy formulation for the circular economy.Research limitations/implicationsThe research approach needs to be tested for practical application with stakeholders which includes individual-community for necessary behavioural change/acceptance, policy measures, innovations for scalability and the new business models so that the changes become an integral part of DNA of new economic model.Practical implicationsEmphasis on reimagined alliance between the environment, economy, and society to achieve the triple bottom line for a sustainable future. In doing so mitigate the impact on nature, generate livelihood opportunities and institute a green industry with an emphasis on circularity by incorporating the principles of ESG, biomimicry and resourcefulness.Originality/valueThe paper addresses the developing frontier of circular economy by identifying and mapping the factors of overlap with principles of ESG and biomimicry with circular economy for a future which is sustainable and resourceful. It attempts to advance the domain of knowledge with suggestion for implementable policy initiative arising from the study., The circular economy has emerged as a key driver in the development of sustainability in the current digital world. Circular economy businesses have generated significant contributions in terms of gross domestic product and employment. In the future, new approaches are needed that meet global trends in digitalisation, resources, and ecological challenges. Instead of solely addressing environmental issues, e-businesses in the digital age need to ensure the sustainable development of the circular economy. This paper proposes a feature-based circular economy e-business model for uplifting environment, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability performance. We have employed indicators that support the implementation of the circular economy process related to technical aspects, reduce the cost of operation and resource pressure, minimise the environmental impact, and maximise social and economic impacts. We present here a comprehensive discussion that provides an in-depth literature review, an emerging e-business model for the circular economy, business, e-business application portfolio, and software application development for sustainable circular economy Business.

They are not antagonistic concepts; they can work together in order to develop and improve business models. A company does not shift her status overnight. The aim of the paper is to analyze the most commonly used business models, on one hand, and to identify some some ways for improvement, by considering synergistic approach of profitability and sustainability, on the other hand. Extended literature indicates the necessity of reshaping business models. In many cases, companies can combine different, but converged, business models simultaneously, or can consider business model portfolio. In short, business model is about putting strategy into action. Concepts like corporate social responsibility or sustainability are more and more present into the companies day by day activities. That does not mean that profitability is passed to second place; its first place is generally accepted and assumed. However, by putting together, profitability and sustainability can drive to a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. In order to sustain and demonstrate that profitability and sustainability can coexist, some correlation analysis was conducted, by including companies from different industries, based on: 2017 Annual Corporate Sustainability Assessment developed by RobecoSAM AG (which include 60 industries and 2479 companies); Dow Jones Sustainability Index and ESG Score (Environment, Social and Governance); data collected from balance sheet, income statement and Bloomberg; Fortune Global 500. The results of the paper reveal that there is a correlation between the most profitable companies in the world and the most sustainable one, but the achieved results of each company are based on different business models.", "This study thoroughly investigates the role of sustainable business models in enhancing environmental sustainability in leading manufacturing companies. Guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we empirically analyse the integration of sustainability goals into corporate strategies. This study identifies sustainable business models based on an analysis of the sustainability reports published on the website, examining the strategies and action plans declared by 30 companies that are leaders in the sustainability industry, according to their Dow Jones Sustainability Index World (DJSI World) and S&P Global ESG Scores. The strategies considered are aligned with the following specific sustainability development goals: 6 (water security); 7 (renewable energy); 12 (responsible consumption and production); and 13 (climate action). The dataset contains several variables, each reflecting a particular facet of a companys environmental sustainability, as follows: energy consumption; greenhouse gas emissions; waste management strategies; and water conservation initiatives. We use a multidimensional data analysis technique called multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). After using MCA, we use a hierarchical clustering algorithm with the aim of classifying the different companies. Our findings underscore the presence of seven clusters of companies. Compared to the well-established literature on the topic of sustainable business, the innovative contribution of this study is linked to the identification of reaction time as a strategic variable explaining the different sustainable business models. The study makes it clear that the different business models are linked to reaction time to strategic alignment with environmental objectives. The country in which the company is based is also important. This study provides practical insights for companies aiming to align their practices with SDGs. In fact, the time variable provides important information in this regard and makes it possible to identify different approaches to sustainability as well as strong and weak sustainable business models; the former are characterised by a medium long-term strategic orientation towards environmental sustainability, which can be interpreted as the desire to undertake more solid and structured environmental sustainability strategies.", 1. INTRODUCTION, GAPS, AND OBJECTIVES Decades of environmental degradation have contributed to transitioning the sustainability discourse from the scientific and technological (Ioannidis and Chalvatzis 2017; Pappas et al. 2018) to the public and corporate domains. Within this context, stakeholders aim to control and mitigate environmental degradation represent wide-ranging institutions and organisations (Goworek et al. 2018; Kumar 2016). Among them, corporate organisations are under pressure to implement strategies that will lead to improved environmental and business performance, which have attracted strong attention in the marketing/management field (Tollin and Christensen 2019). This is particularly true in an international business context, where due to growing globalization trends, firms have to demonstrate responsible citizenship for sustainability not only in their home market, but also in host countries. However, sustainability has been conceptualized in a relatively vague way by researchers, which, coupled with the great diversity of its drivers and outcomes (Chalvatzis et al. 2018) reported by the sizable literature in the field, causes confusion in promoting best practice and advancing theory (Eccles, Ioannou, and Serafeim 2012). In light of these problems, there is a need to systematically review and assess the extant body of research on the antecedents and performance outcomes of international environmental marketing/management strategies. In doing so, our review intents to: (a) identify and analyse the theoretical background of this line of research; (b) assess the research methodologies employed by previous empirical studies; (c) identify and assimilate the key thematic areas and specific topics addressed by prior research; and (d) identify the key variables used in the existing literature (e) develop an agenda for future research on the subject. 2. METHODOLOGY A two-stage process was adopted for the present review: article identification and article analysis. In order to identify the initial pool of articles, we adopted the concept-driven systematic review method approach (Webster and Watson 2002). To accumulate a complete census of relevant literature and build the initial pool of studies, articles with relevant topics were searched in various electronic databases, such as Ebsco, Scopus and Science Direct, which provide a comprehensive coverage with full access. We have used the following keywords to identify relevant articles: environmental marketing; environmental strategy; green marketing; environmentally friendly; sustainable marketing; natural environment; environmental orientation; environmental proactivity; environmental awareness; and environmental management. This was done in conjunction with international-related keywords, namely multinational firms; global corporations; global consumers; international marketing; cross-cultural marketing; and cross-national marketing. These keywords were identified from previous reviews on the subject and were refined by two established scholars in the field. We searched these pre-defined keywords in article title, author supplied keywords, and author supplied abstract. We limited our search to articles published in English in academic peer-reviewed journals, since the inception of this field of research in the early 1960s. This initial search from the various electronic databases yielded 949 articles, of which 498 had to be removed because of being duplicated while another 167 were found irrelevant after carefully screening the title and the abstract. 2.1 Article identification We critically appraised the full text of the remaining 284 potentially relevant articles, by taking into consideration the following four criteria with regard to the studies contained: (1) to be published in an academic journal rather than a book, book chapters or conference proceedings; (2) to focus on environmental marketing/management strategies as an independent concept, rather than as a sub-dimension of Corporate Social Responsibility; (3) to be of an international nature, by examining the sustainability strategies of firms (e.g., exporters, MNEs, etc.) when crossing their national boundaries; and (4) to have empirical nature, with papers having a conceptual, methodological, review, or meta-analytical nature being excluded. Only 68 articles met these pre-defined selection criteria, which were subsequently examined by two academic experts in order to verify their appropriateness. The outcome of this process was to exclude another seven articles. We have carefully reviewed the reference lists of the 61 articles that passed the cross check, revealing another 34 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria set, thus bringing the final sample of articles useful for the review to 95. 2.2 Article analysis To map research on the antecedents and outcomes of environmental marketing/management strategy within the international marketing context, we proceeded with a content analysis of the selected articles. In doing so, we have designed a coding frame incorporating publication details, theories undertaken located mainly in developed economies with less attention paid on emerging and developing economies. The majority of the reviewed studies had a particular focus on manufacturing industries where there are studies where multiple industries are included which allows for examination of industry type control effects. More recent studies start to examine other industries such as energy, tourism, transportation, and other service industries. The vast majority of the research is undertaken using primary data and few studies used secondary ESG data sourced by national or third-party institutions. The articles were classified into six broad thematic categories and multiple sub-categories such as (1) energy efficiency; (2) water conversation; (3) green supply chain management; (4) waste management; (5) product/ service eco- friendliness; and (6) emissions reduction. 3.2 Study Implications Based on the thematic clustering undertaken, we developed an integrative framework for environmental marketing and management practices and a coherent agenda for future research directions. The systematic review confirms that managers might adopt environmentally friendly marketing/ management strategy as a means of increasing their performance. Competences such knowledge, systems and routines developed within the company are found to stimulate a proactive environmental strategy which research has shown that can enhance different performance outcomes.]|

This is why it is of utmost importance to build a shared and accepted framework to define what we really mean by ESG overcoming the "minimalist" Do Not Significantly Harm (DNSH) principle and moving toward the full achievement of the more ambitious substantial contribution (SC) principle, oriented to the maximization of the social and environmental impact of value creation. To move forward in this direction, our work proposes a relational approach for the assessment of ESG factors focusing in particular on the social pillar. Our conceptual and theoretical proposal argues that, in order to increase the value of that pillar, it is necessary to assess both the internal and external relationships of the firm from an impact perspective, improving at the same time the multidimensional well-being of workers and the capacity to create sustainable development in the local community. The main factors companies should consider to achieve these goals are related to the domains of sense of community, empowerment, good practices of mutual aid and degree of participation at individual, team, organization, and territorial levels that can trigger gift giving, reciprocity and trust, overcoming standard social dilemmas and producing superadditive outcomes together with high social and environmental impact. Starting from these elements, this work proposes a set of indicators and metrics, based on an original methodology to measure and assess the commitment of a firm to increasing social factors. This methodology is particularly suitable for SMEs and start-up companies., The social and ecological processes impacting on urban forests have been studied at multiple temporal and spatial scales in order to help us quantify, monitor, and value the ecosystem services that benefit people. Few studies have comprehensively analyzed the full suite of ecosystem services, goods (ESG), and ecosystem disservices provided by an urban forest. Indicators, however, are one approach that could be used to better understand the structure of an urban forest, the suite of ESG provided by urban forests, and their influence on human well-being using a simple, innovative and repeatable metric. This study presents a framework for developing indicators using field data, an urban forest functional model, and the literature. Urban tree and soil indicators for groups of ecosystem functions were used to statistically analyze the effects of urban morphology and socioeconomics on urban forest ESG. Findings show that the most influential ESG indicators were tree cover, soil pH, and soil organic matter. Indicators were significantly influenced by land use and time since urbanization, while analyses of property values and household income did not yield any particularly significant results. The indicators presented in this paper present a first approach to non-monetary valuation of urban forest ESG and can be used to develop urban forest structure management goals and to monitor the effects of urban greening policies on human well-being.

All rights reserved., "Owing to the increasing trends of the LOHAS lifestyle (LOHASism) adopted by a majority of Taiwanese communities, most community development associations have begun to explore the most effective LOHASism sustainable development strategies for advancing a high-quality lifestyle for these extensive community residents. Hence, this research cross-employed the three core principles in LOHASism, three analytical dimensions (environment, society and governance) of Environment Society and Governance (ESG) and 17 evaluated sustainable indexes of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to effectively induce the determinants of ESG for a community LOHASism sustainable development strategy. Significantly, the three most valuable conclusions and contributive findings are: (1) the main research question has been comprehensively solved through interdisciplinary analyses of the consolidation among the three principles (Dogood, Feelgood, Lookgood) of LOHASism, three dimensions of ESG and 17 evaluated sustainable indexes of the SDGs; (2) the highest scale of standardized comparative weights was located in the Positively Promoting Community Development Sustainability (PPCDS) of 0.7194, which means LOHASism, ESG and SDGs did positively promote community sustainable development in order and empirically achieved the brief research goal; and (3) industry, innovation and infrastructure (III), reduced inequality and responsible consumption and production in the governance of the EGS into LOHASism were the highest three weighted scales in the Positively Promoting Community Development Sustainability (PPCDS). This means that most communitys residents expect the advancement of innovation and infrastructure (III), the improvement of reduced inequality and the increment of responsible consumption and production to be the top three critical sustainable development strategies in their community development governance in order to advance the most residents to be good-looking and have body health."

However, government policies have been ignored, public opinion has not been updated, the local tourism infrastructure is incomplete, and operational practices have been poor for a long time. This is because ecotourism has not made any empirical profits, and additionally, it has even incurred more practical costs, which have encouraged few tourism agents to execute and operate ecotourism correctly. The contributive findings of this study are the following: (1) Beyond the evaluated measurements of quantitative and qualitative analyses, the sustainable development of ecotourism essentially creates benefits for the local industry and the environment, and actively assists the industry in improving the business environment, in enhancing service quality, and in creating ecotourism benefits. (2) It is very apparent that the tourism offices of central and local governments, as well as related travel agents and local organizations, have to be trained with regard to the appropriate consumption of sightseeing products, with a consideration of productive yield and a critical focus on quality instead of quantity. Particular attention should also be given to local traveling capacity as well as support for regional development. The maintenance of the local cultural landscape or ecological integrity can directly offer tourists an unprecedented travel experience, which could encourage them to share their knowledge with others in society after traveling, and consequently promote the sustainable development of ecotourism. (3) The results point to the fact that the tourism offices of central and local governments, related travel agents, and local organizations require training in providing special assistance to local residents with regard to the conservation of natural resources. Special training must likewise be provided concerning environmental protection, allowing them to educate the tourists in terms of politely respecting local traditions, norms, and cultures while traveling, since these activities are directly related to the sustainable development of ecotourism. Predictably, beyond this research, these three contributive findings can directly become the research foundation of future works that intend to focus on the sustainability of global ecotourism., "Rural tourism is closely related to the protection of traditional villages and the utilisation of local cultural and natural environment. The cultural tourism in traditional villages can promote the dissemination and inheritance of traditional culture. However, currently, there are very few papers on the ecological efficiency (eco-efficiency) of cultural tourism in traditional villages; and there are defects with the few existing literatures such as the single research object and unreasonable evaluation index system, and the research in this field is still in the stage of improvement and development. Therefore, to fill in this research gap, this paper aims to study the spatial-temporal changes of the eco-efficiency of cultural tourism in traditional villages and measure and analyse the said eco-efficiency. At first, this paper gave a few village planning cases in China and introduced the concept of ecological supply gap (ESG), which is used to measure the gap between the demand of tourists tourism activities for the natural environment in traditional villages and the supply provided by the natural environment in traditional villages to human beings. Then, from the perspectives of absolute difference and relative difference, this paper explored the trends and laws in the spatial-temporal changes of eco-efficiency within the study period. After that, this paper proposed to view the problem of the influence of tourism economy development on the cultural tourism in traditional villages from four aspects: tourism service level, tourism industry structure, tourist scale, and tourist consumption capacity. At last, the measurement and calculation results of eco-efficiency were given, and the spatial correlation of eco-efficiency was analysed.", "Sustainable Tourism integrates governance, economic, socio-cultural and environmental dimensions of tourism in tourism development and management. Growing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) concerns suggest that, traditionally, tourism tends to corrupt the very resources it needs to thrive, and thus its sustainability over the long haul has become of general concern. However, despite the vast and extensive literature dedicated to this field, the concept of sustainability in tourism remains somehow at its embryonic stage, especially in the case of a small island developing state (SIDS). With tourism being one of the pillars of the Mauritian economy, this paper explored its different sustainability implications and impacts with the use of different frameworks: the United Nations World Tourism Organisations framework and the Global Sustainable Tourism Councils guidelines. The research sketches a portrait of the current tourism practices in Mauritius and suggests sustainable tourism opportunities for the Mauritian tourism sector. Given the qualitative and narrative nature of this research, a scoring method system was used to enable data analysis. Findings from this research overall concluded that despite the increased importance of sustainable tourism, the need for managed tourism and the formulation of general principles and guidelines, tourism governance; poverty reduction; and the sustainability of the natural and cultural environment were identified as areas of particular need and should be considered with high priority for intervention/action. To improve the competitiveness of this tourism destination on its road to sustainability, the management mechanism and governance system should be reviewed, the responsibility of tourism as a contributor to poverty alleviation and social inclusion should be considered, and finally, the carrying capacity of the destination as it relates to the sustainability of the social, natural and cultural environment should be recognised as intrinsic components of the, so to speak, goose that so far has laid the golden egg."

A variety of regulations and standards power the sustainability management of the global maritime sector, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the European Unions new draft European Sustainability Reporting Standard. Limited research on the potential contribution of maritime policy-making to support sustainable development has led the sector to face multiple challenges. In this study, we analyzed how local policy-making can impact international goals and global sustainable development based on comprehensive datasets of 143 maritime companies. The study recommends the incorporation of sustainability dimensions of the maritime sector into all levels of policy-making and supporting the policy implementation with the local maritime governance structure. A maritime country should have strategic planning objectives that embrace maritime affairs and use the interactions identified between local development and the maritime sector. We propose a framework for maritime policy-making that supports sustainable development. A maturity model for sustainable development in the maritime sector was developed. The results can be used as guidelines for policymakers in planning sustainable development in a maritime country.", "Strengthened International Maritime Organization environmental regulations, the Poseidon principles, and other environmental changes require shipping companies to expand their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments. ESG management is evolving as an essential requirement to enhance the competitiveness of global liner shipping companies. Under these circumstances, this study aims to provide policy guidelines and future directions for the development of ESG management in Korean shipping companies. Accordingly, we selected four companies under THE Alliance, which is an ESG standard leader in shipping. Based on each shipping companys sustainability reports from 2019 to 2021, we analyzed the major ESG performance factors required for a company to achieve its sustainability goals, developing four research questions. Based on multiple case study theory, we compared each companys ESG management status and main characteristics using the quadruple helix model, proposing three measures to improve the ESG management of Korean shipping companies: 1. Cultivate ESG experts specialized in the maritime field; 2. Strengthen support for small- and medium-sized companies; 3. Construct a maritime-specialized ESG evaluation system and introduce voluntary management culture. Our findings contribute to the maritime industrys development by identifying necessary factors and proposing improvement directions that will help Korean shipping companies to secure global competitiveness.", "The main aim of this study is to investigate the incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concepts into the operational structure of Indonesian Ports, with a specific emphasis on Port Indonesia. The research methodology employed in this study was qualitative, involving comprehensive literature studies and analysis of secondary data sources. The data collection entailed compiling information from various sources, including scholarly journals, company reports, and official government documents. The gathered data underwent a thorough and systematic analysis to uncover and comprehend pertinent patterns, issues, and connections about the research subject. The results indicate that the Port of Indonesia has achieved notable progress in achieving economic sustainability, as seen by its consistent improvement in important financial indicators throughout the previous three years. Nevertheless, the findings about environmental sustainability and community engagement exhibited a heterogeneous trend, wherein specific locations showed noteworthy dedication while others showcased a need for more consistency. The data presented demonstrates a solid commitment to social sustainability, as seen by the companys concentrated endeavors to improve community involvement and promote the welfare of the local population. The Port of Indonesia has exhibited a solid dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, specifically emphasizing economic sustainability. Despite experiencing volatility, the environmental and local participation components have displayed an overall tendency of persistent dedication toward improvement. Maintaining consistent focus on these elements and ongoing surveillance and documentation is essential to ensure long-term sustainability and uncover potential opportunities for improvement."

The study has shown that there is no definite and unique relationship between corporate sustainability and economic value. Based on the results of the structural modelling, sustainable value model ESGVA is methodologically improved. The model expresses all four dimensions of corporate sustainability: environmental, social, corporate governance and economic. The case study demonstrates how different the results are if a purely economic concept of company value is used compared to value that takes into account environmental, social and corporate governance factors. The model is applicable to comparative analysis of socially responsible investments. Sustainable value provides extra information on corporate performance and can be used for decision-making of individual investors., The Sustainable Value-Added Model is a new approach in value-oriented strategic management that focuses on maximizing the value that is created by non-financial sustainability indicators. The objective of this paper is to refine the calculation of sustainable added value by incorporating environmental, social, and corporate governance sustainability indicators, assigning weights to the indicators and, by alternative methods, assigning target values to the indicators. Ten alternative models of Sustainable Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Value Added were created. The models encompass 11 environmental, social, and corporate governance indicators of sustainability, and two economic indicators (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, and Value Added). Indicator values are related to the target values that represent the opportunity costs. The quality of the models was assessed by statistical methods, i.e., the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Gini index, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. The results of these statistics show sufficient quality of all the models proposed. The most accurate model is that with the economic indicator Value Added and target values that are based on the values of the company with the best economic results., "The aim of the paper is to propose a model for measuring sustainable value which would complexly assess environmental, social, and corporate governance contribution to value creation. In the paper the concept of the Sustainable Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Value Added is presented. The Sustainable Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Value Added is based on the Sustainable Value Added model and combines weighted environmental, social, and corporate governance indicators with their benchmarks determined by Data Envelopment Analysis. Benchmark values of indicators were set for each company separately and determine the optimal combination of environmental, social, and corporate governance inputs to economic outcomes. The Sustainable Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Value Added methodology is applied on real-life corporate data and presented through a case study. The value added of most of the selected companies was negative, even though economic indicators of all of them are positive. The Sustainable Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Value Added is intended to help owners, investors, and other stakeholders in their decision-making and sustainability assessment. The use of environmental, social, and corporate governance factors helps identify the companys strengths and weaknesses, and provides a more sophisticated insight into it than the one-dimensional methods based on economic performance alone."

Specifically, we investigate if and to what extent banks with lower ESG scores are considered less profitable and riskier than those characterized by higher ones, and by taking into consideration both the joint and the separate effects of ESG dimensions. Using panel estimation methods on listed global systemically important bank and less significant European banks, over the period 2014-2020, we find that banks with higher ESG scores are perceived as more profitable and less risky by the market, thus supporting the risk mitigation view. Interestingly, our findings reveal that investors behave in the same way, regardless of the size of the bank, when assessing the impact of ESG scores on the banks return and risk. Our evidence is robust to selection bias and endogeneity concerns. Overall, the results support the ESG regulatory policy on mandatory disclosures of non-financial reporting for larger entities and emphasize the need to enhance its benefits and extend it also to smaller banks.", "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate whether banks environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives increase or decrease banks efficiency.Design/methodology/approachThe sample used includes all listed banks in Saudi Arabia over the years 2016-2021. The authors performed different methods, including data envelopment analysis (DEA), ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regressions.FindingsThe OLS regression results show a negative linkage between ESG and banks efficiency. Further, the quantile regression analysis indicates that the ESG effect on banks efficiency is negative across different quantiles. However, the DEA method shows that the DEA-generated scores for Banks efficiency are higher for ESG-adjusted scores in comparison to efficiency scores without incorporating ESG. Further, the comparison of the DEA-generated efficiency scores, over the sample period, of adjusted ESG banks still suffers from decreasing in their efficiency over the years. Concerning existing theory, the results are consistent with the stakeholders and the resource-based theories postulating that banks ESG practices are ethical commitments and enable firms to gain competitive advantage and increase their reputation among stakeholders.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study offer important implications for regulators and bankers. Policymakers and bank regulators should make collective efforts to encourage financial institutions to adopt green finance initiatives to create an efficient financial system capable of counteracting risks from the external environment and stimulating economic growth. Banks managers should be aware that ESG initiatives serve society and the environment and offer a positive influence on banks efficiency.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study to explore the influence of ESG activities on banks efficiency using DEA for banks in Saudi Arabia.", "The global financial crisis reignited concerns regarding the stability and sustainability of banks. Since liquidity creation (LC) is a core output of banks, we examine if the nexus between LC and bank stability is conditional on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) disclosure by banks. Our sample comprises 178 commercial banks (1568 observations) during the period 2010-2019 in the Asia-Pacific region. Using a two-step system GMM estimation, our results document a positive impact of LC on bank stability. Additionally, ESG disclosures positively moderate the stability effect of LC, i.e., higher LC is associated with significantly more enhancement in bank stability for banks that have a higher disclosure of ESG scores compared to banks that have a moderate disclosure. Furthermore, we also provide evidence of variation in the moderating role of ESG disclosures in advanced and emerging economies. Overall, our results recommend that integrating ESG practices into banks internal processes improves their financial soundness. Additionally, blanket implementation of liquidity regulations might be detrimental to banks stability."

It also examines how regulatory focus influences the relationship between purchase intention and brand credibility.<br /> Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a quantitative approach, utilizing an online survey of 464 Taiwanese consumers. The data collected is analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of perceived ESG information transparency and quality on brand prominence, brand credibility and purchase intentions. Findings - The findings reveal that perceived transparency and quality of ESG information significantly enhance brand credibility and prominence. Consequently, increased brand credibility and prominence have a significant positive impact on consumer purchase intentions. Additionally, the study identifies a moderation effect, wherein a prevention regulatory focus strengthens the influence of brand credibility on purchase intentions.<br /> Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature on brand management and consumer behavior by integrating regulatory focus theory with the impacts of ESG information. It provides new insights into how ESG-related communications influence consumer behavior, highlighting the importance of transparent and high-quality ESG data in fostering consumer trust and positive brand evaluations.", "To overcome the serious climate crisis, the world must achieve carbon neutrality. Corporate participation is essential to achieve carbon neutrality, and ESG management is required to realize this. Additional efforts and costs are involved for a company to manage ESG. If a companys ESG management is helpful for the companys sustainable growth, the company will be willing to endure the effort and cost. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the impact of corporate ESG management on the brand. This study empirically analyzed the effects of corporate ESG management on brand image, brand attitude, brand attachment, and brand loyalty. ESG activities were divided into environmental and social and governance, to classify their impact. As a result of the study, it was found that environmental activities did not have a positive effect on brand image, brand attitude, and brand attachment. Social and governance activities were found to have a positive effect on brand image and brand attitude. In addition, it was found that social and governance activities affect brand loyalty through brand image, brand attitude, and brand attachment. The results of this study provide practical implications for corporate ESG management, and have theoretical significance in that they have expanded ESG-related research areas to consumer behavior, corporate strategy, and future economic fields.", "This paper explores whether consumers perceptions of environmental, social and governance initiatives can impact on attitude, and how three brand-related constructs-brand credibility, brand image and perceived quality-mediate this relationship. An online survey was conducted with 458 South Korean consumers, and the data were investigated through a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The empirical results indicated direct positive effects of social and governance dimensions of perceived ESG on brand credibility, brand image, and perceived quality. However, no direct impact of the environmental dimension of perceived ESG on brand-related constructs was identified. Further, the results confirmed that brand credibility, brand image and perceived quality partially mediate the relationship between perceived ESG and attitude. Based on the findings, this paper suggests implications and future research directions."

We used a methodology that combined bibliometric analysis and case studies that included the integration of sustainability in different banking institutions. What was observed as a result of the study is that a correct adoption of the principles of long-term sustainability have multiple benefits: - increasing operational efficiency - improving the image of banks; positive impact on society and the environment. Through this research we hope to add to the specialized literature, coming with clear evidence that the banking environment can contribute with a positive impact on sustainability. The decision-making factors in the management and the board of the banking institutions use these evidences as information that can later be transformed into performance indicators, indicators that will contribute through their results to encouraging the implementation of sustainable development within the banks. We know that the future comes with climatic challenges, or precisely a sustainable banking strategy that includes the analysis of all risks can generate a balance sheet behind anticipated. This integration of sustainability in the banking sector encompasses environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles; ESG has gained increasing attention in recent years. "Sustainable economic development has become an important factor on the agenda of various economic and business institutions, so banks and financial institutions are also an essential part of this trend" (Tarkhanova, 2018). Case studies from real institutions are included to exemplify successful implementations (BNP PARIBAS Personal Finance). Although it faces challenges and obstacles, the banking sector has much to gain by adopting sustainability from a social, corporate governance and economic perspective., PurposeGrowing concern over sustainability adoption has presented an array of challenges to businesses. While vital to an economy\s success, banking is not immune to societal, environmental and economic consequences of business practices. The study has examined the sustainable performance of banking institutions on the suggested multidimensional framework comprising economic, environmental, social, governance and financial dimensions and 52 sustainability indicators. The study benchmarks the significant performance indicators of leading banks indispensable to sustainable banking performance. The findings attempt to address research questions concerning the extent of sustainable banking performance, ranking the sustainability dimensions and indicators and standardizing sustainability adoption metrics.Design/methodology/approachTo determine the responsiveness of the banking industry to sustainability dimensions, content analysis was conducted using NVivo software for the year 2021-2022. Furthermore, a hybrid multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is used by integrating entropy, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) to provide relative weights to performance indicators and prioritize banks based on their sustainable performance. Sensitivity analysis is used to ensure the robustness of results.FindingsIn the context of the Indian banking industry, the pattern of sustainability reporting is inconsistent and concentrated on addressing environmental and social concerns. The results of the entropy methodology prioritized "Environmental" sustainability over other selected dimensions while "Financial" dimension has been assigned the least priority in the ranking order. The significant sustainable performance indicators delineated in this study should be used as standards to ensure the accountability and credibility of the sustainable banking industry. Additionally, the research findings will provide valuable inputs to policymakers and regulators to assure better contribution of the banking sector in meeting sustainability goals.Originality/valueConsidering the paucity of studies on sustainable banking performance, this study makes two significant contributions to the literature. First, the suggested multidimensional disclosure model integrating financial and nonfinancial indicators would facilitate banking institutions in addressing the five aspects of sustainability. As one of the first studies in the context of the Indian banking industry, the findings would pave the way for better diffusion of sustainability practices. Second, the inclusion of MCDM techniques prioritizes the significance of sustainability indicators and benchmarks the performance of leading banks to achieve better profits and more substantial growth., "PurposeSustainable development (SD) is widely acknowledged as the center around which all development efforts should revolve. Banking is a crucial component of SD, and the adoption of sustainable banking practices by various banking institutions is a powerful catalyst for its achievement. This paper aims to investigate the level of adoption of environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators in India and the extent to which financial institutions use these strategies. In addition, the banks have been classified according to their sustainable banking performance and showing a relationship between ESG and sustainability. Design/methodology/approachAn ESG framework has been developed for the Indian banking system that focuses on the behavior of banks. The evaluation of literature helps to identify the gaps in particular frameworks for analyzing sustainable banking practices in developing nations because of the variation in economic criteria between developed and developing countries. An attempt to construct a common framework for measuring the banking sectors sustainable efforts has been done in the past. Specifically in India, where the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability are of equal importance to governance indicators, these studies fall short of providing relevant indicators. Multiple financial reports, nonfinancial reports, corporate social responsibility reports and business responsibility reports of this sector were analyzed using content analysis techniques against ESG indicators for sustainability attainment. FindingsThe result of this study shows that both the sectors are disclosing their environmental indicators more as compared to other dimensions. While the analysis says that private companies are going better than public companies in terms of disclosing their ESG indicators. As compared to the international banking sector, adoption of Global Reporting Initiatives standards, United Nations Environment Programme Financial Initiatives (UNEP FI), Green Credit Policy and Equator Principles (EP) is near to the ground in India. IDFC bank is the only entity that started implementing EP practices and Yes bank also is doing a wonderful implementation of the green policies and is the signatory to UNEP FI. Practical implicationsThe current state of sustainable banking in India is reflected in the implementation of the proposed framework. To better integrate sustainability problems into banking, this study provides helpful information for banks and other stakeholders. In addition, this study corrects the lack of research in the Indian context on sustainable banking. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge by far, this is one of the prime studies to inspect the degree of ESG disclosure by the Indian banking sector in their sustainability report."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The presence of these activities in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is still in its early stages in the literature, requiring further empirical evidence. Given the importance of SMEs in economy and based on Stakeholder Theory, a set of hypotheses regarding the influence of ESG on financial and risk performance has been tested using a sample of 538 Spanish SMEs. Specifically, an index has been developed to assess ESG at both global and individual levels. The study analyses the impact of these variables on corporate performance, taking into account factors such as the pandemic period, level of disclosure and the size effect. The results demonstrate the importance of developing and index tailored to measuring ESG within this type of company, as the methodology employed can impact the outcomes. Moreover, at the individual level, all dimensions reflect a significant relationship, but the overall ESG score does not. The social and labor dimensions prove to be the most beneficial indices for enhancing resilience during periods of crisis. Finally, the findings confirm that it is more difficult for SMEs to monetize the results of ESG investment and that disclosing these activities has a positive impact. This study contributes to existing knowledge by constructing a robust measure of the level of ESG implementation and quality, providing valuable insights for SMEs on how to effectively manage their ESG activities., "In recent times, there has been a global shift towards sustainable finance, aligning financial activities with environmental, social, and governance principles (ESG). This trend is crucial for promoting sustainable businesses and driving positive change, especially in East Africa where small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in economic growth and job creation. Sustainable finance adoption within the SME sector is key to long-term economic sustainability and environmental responsibility. A mixed-methods approach was employed, utilizing the multi-regression model in SPSS 29.0 to analyze the outcomes. The multi-regression analysis of panel data from 150 private venture capital (VC) companies indicates that enhanced access to sustainable finance, proactive government engagement, and robust policy frameworks accounted for 14.7% of the observed long-term sustainability successes among SMEs. This translated to enhanced productivity and growth within the SME sector. The study carries significant policy implications. It highlights the importance of policymakers promoting and incentivizing the adoption of sustainable finance practices among SMEs. Additionally, investors who prioritize ESG factors can drive demand for sustainable finance options, supporting SMEs that prioritize sustainability. This collaboration between policymakers and investors can promote sustainable business practices, ensuring the success and resilience of SMEs while advancing overall sustainability goals. However, the studys limited scope and the nascent stage of the field may constrain the findings applicability, underscoring the ongoing necessity to expand sustainable finance access and policy frameworks to support SMEs in their environmentally responsible strategies for enduring success and resilience", "The aim of the paper is to define the important factors of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Business Ethics (BE), and Human Resource Management (HRM), and to quantify their impact on the formation of positive attitudes of SMEs towards the concept of Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) and its acceptance. To support the achievement of this goal, empirical research was conducted in the Visegrad Group (V4 countries) with a sample of 1,056 respondents in March 2024. The defined scientific hypotheses were verified through the Ordered Least Model (OLM). The research results indicate the following trends. Selected factors from CSR, BE, and HRM demonstrated an influence on shaping the positive attitudes of SMEs toward understanding and accepting the ESG concept. Empirical research confirmed that the CSR domain significantly influences the positive approach of SMEs towards ESG. This study in the HRM field emphasises the importance of a participatory leadership style for employees. This approach, among other benefits, contributes to a positive attitude of SMEs towards understanding and accepting the ESG concept. Planning the qualification and career growth of employees does not represent significant factors in shaping the positive stance of SMEs towards ESG. SMEs attitudes in the BE field clearly indicate that a consistent approach by managers in implementing anti-corruption measures shapes the right approaches of SMEs towards ESG. On the other hand, the formal declaration of applying BE in the activities of SMEs and the existence of a moral code do not positively influence the perception on ESG."

The second aim is to present conditions for inclusion of environmental and climate risk analysis in the process of monitoring financial stability. Design/methodology/approach: Banks standalone audited statements for 2018 were used as a source of data. In defining 8 key areas of environmental risk management within the ESG, the banks environmental and climate actions were systematised to draw conclusions on the nature of the initiatives taken and on which types of banks in a given area express commitment and whether it is related to the banks scale, shareholding structure and financial standing. Findings: The scope of information on a banks involvement in the environmental and climate protection process is not uniform. In the case of smaller private banks and banks with a dominant Treasury shareholding in the ownership structure, this scope is much smaller than in the case of large and medium-sized private banks belonging to global financial holdings. A particularly important commitment to environmental and climate protection in the sector concerns banks belonging to European capital groups that have signed up to international agreements on economic decarbonisation. The scarce information provided by banks with a dominant Treasury shareholding results from the high level of exposure of these banks to companies from high-carbon sectors, also owned by the Treasury. Commercial banks in Poland place the main emphasis on presenting their direct impact on the environment (reduction of energy and other media consumption, recycling and environmental campaigns). Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to the commercial banking sector and only to one reporting period. However, there are no constraints to apply the proposed approach to other samples and for longer data series, and then build a methodology of environmental rating. Originality/value: This article is the first comparative analysis of the involvement of Polish commercial banks in environmental and climate protection. Its results are particularly useful for investors for whom ESG criteria constitute important determinants of decisions.", "Sustainable development, as a new political and economic doctrine of the global economy, has been manifesting for a long time in the energy transformation of the EU Member States. In July 2021, the European Commission renewed its sustainable finance strategy, pointing out that in the current decade, Europe will need additional investments to achieve its climate targets, expecting, in connection with their implementation, an increase in private sector expenditure. Financial institutions, including banks, joined this process. The article presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among representatives of the largest commercial banks in Poland, aimed at identifying the importance of greening their loan portfolios. The main aim of the paper is the exegesis of bank risk, taking into account the escalation due to factors that have destabilized banks lending activity in recent years, including the growing ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risk. The following research methods were used: survey research, a literature review, observation method, synthesis method and cause -and -effect analysis - all of which enabled the adoption of the main research hypothesis (H1), which assumes that the constantly growing interest and involvement of domestic banks in green loans increases the regulatory mix of bank risk, becoming a serious challenge for the banking compliance function. The research results presented in the article indicate that banking institutions in Poland are increasing their involvement in the implementation of sustainable finance assumptions, and green investments have better chances of financing in commercial banks in Poland. However, despite the ongoing process of greening the credit portfolios of commercial banks in Poland, financing green investments does not change their approach to bank risk management.", "The concept of sustainable development has been gaining importance and increasing societys awareness of the need to stop climate change, inequality, social exclusion, and inappropriate corporate practices. Banks increasingly integrate ESG objectives into their business activity. However, it is associated with their exposure to a new type of risk - the ESG risk. ESG risk management for banking institutions has now become not only a fashion and trend but an obligation that they have to fulfil. The main aim of the article is to identify ESG risk and methods of quantification, as well as to assess the exposure to ESG risk of commercial banks in Poland. Thats why the paper presents an in-depth literature review in the field of ESG concept and ESG risk in banks. Then, it describes the adopted methodology of the empirical research. The third section covers a presentation of the obtained results, which include the analysis of ESG risk exposure of the largest banks in the world and selected commercial banks in Poland, mainly based on the volume of the carbon footprint they generate and finally, ESG risk ratings for Polish banks. The following research methods were used in the article: literature studies, case study analysis, observation methods and synthesis methods. The empirical research that was conducted allowed the verification of the research hypothesis, stating that commercial banks in Poland are aware of the need to measure and monitor ESG risk increases. The research indicated that some of the banks in Poland are at an advanced stage of ESG risk management, while the rest of them are just starting their activities in this area. Currently, banks involvement in ESG issues globally is one of the leading market trends. It becomes not only an option but an imperative for institutions wishing to maintain their market position. Therefore, commercial banks in Poland can and should participate in the implementation of sustainable development assumptions in the coming years."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

However, corporate ESG performance cannot be achieved without the support of financial development and the underlying mechanisms through which fintech development affects corporate ESG performance in emerging markets remain unexplored. Firms that are less financially constrained exhibit higher ESG performance in cities with better developed fintech. Moreover, the results remain robust after addressing the endogeneity between fintech development and ESG performance and using different city-level fintech indexes. Additionally, the results remain robust after addressing the endogeneity between fintech development and ESG performance and using different model specifications and variable measurement. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the effect of fintech development on ESG performance is stronger for firms that are small, operate in technology industries, and have financial executives. These findings provide new insights into the role of fintech development in promoting sustainable social and economic development., The fulfillment of ESG responsibility by enterprises is crucial to achieving China\s "double carbon goal " and the sustainable development of the whole society. However, ESG development is facing financing constraints and information asymmetry, while the rapid development of fintech supports ESG development to improve quality and efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial to study the impact of fintech on corporate ESG development. Can financial technology (FinTech) "empower " traditional financial institutions with technology to improve corporate ESG performance? Based on this, this paper examines the relationship between regional FinTech development and corporate ESG performance and its underlying mechanisms from internal and external perspectives, using data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2020. The following were found: 1) The level of regional FinTech development significantly contributes to firms\ ESG performance, and the results remain robust after mitigating endogeneity using Bartik instrumental variables and difference-in-differences model estimation. 2) Mechanistic analysis finds that FinTech not only alleviates the internal financing constraints of firms, but also enhances the external government subsidies and tax rebates of firms. These significantly contribute to the improvement of firms\ ESG performance. 3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that the contribution of FinTech to improving corporate ESG performance is more pronounced in the eastern region, mature firms and firms with CEOs with unbanked financial backgrounds. Therefore, in the context of sustainable development, we should continue to promote the development of FinTech, use modern technology to "empower " finance, and help enterprises balance economic and social benefits to build a sustainable country., This study investigates how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors affect the financial performance of fintech companies in Jordan, with a focus on sustainable fintech practices. The study employed a survey methodology, distributing questionnaires to employees in the Jordanian fintech sector to gather primary data. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), ensuring methodological rigor through a robust sample size. The findings reveal that ESG factors have a significant positive impact on fintech performance, which is further enhanced by the adoption of sustainable practices. This underscores the critical role of sustainability in fintech operations and provides actionable insights for industry professionals and policymakers aiming to promote responsible growth. The study contributes to the literature by advancing understanding of ESG integration within fintech and laying the groundwork for future research. It highlights the importance of sustainable practices in enhancing financial performance and provides a foundation for exploring how these practices influence fintech operations. Future research should consider the evolving regulatory environment and its impact on ESG integration in fintech. Longitudinal studies could investigate the sustainability-performance relationship over time, revealing trends and obstacles as fintech firms expand. Additionally, comparative studies across different regions or sectors could offer insights into how various factors shape ESG adoption and its effects on financial outcomes. These future directions will improve our understanding of sustainable fintech and support the global development of responsible financial innovations.

To do this, new mining platforms should have not only innovative and technological, but also social-and-economic coverage of the latest competencies, which Mining 4.0 fully corresponds to. The achievements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, embodied in "end-to-end" digital and convergent technologies, are able to ensure the stable development of the mineral resource sector in the face of fluctuations in raw material demand and the profitability of mining enterprises, strengthening environmental safety legislation. Mining 4.0 is also a response to the technological shocks associated with the accelerated digital modernization of the manufacturing and infrastructure industries. This article attempts to give a multilateral overview of mining industries transformation in the course of the diffusion of Industry 4.0 technologies, to highlight the core and frontiers of Mining 4.0 expansion, to show the opportunities and threats of replacing physical systems and humans in mining with cyber-physical systems. Further, the technological, economic and social horizons of the transformation of Mining 4.0 into Mining 5.0 with specific threats of total digitalization are discussed., "In the South African context, legislation around artisanal and small-scale mining largely focusses on small and industrialised mining, making no room for any artisanal type of mining. Consequently, excluding historically disadvantaged people from the mineral riches of South Africa. Artisanal miners are marginalised by default, and often also labelled as illegal. Therefore, the sector is either ignored or suppressed by powerful actors like mining companies and the government. With South Africas high unemployment rate and rife poverty levels, alternative ways of development are urgently needed. Not enough jobs are being created in the formal sector to absorb unemployed or job-seeking individuals. A failure on the part of mining companies to develop informal sectors like the artisanal mining sector limits socio-economic opportunities for ordinary South Africans, including the poor. In this article, the authors explore the role corporations can play in developing and addressing artisanal mining in the South African context. A significant opportunity for mining companies to boost their ESG (environmental, social and governance) ratings and improve their social license to operate may be harnessed by involving Zama Zama miners in corporate social responsibility efforts. The article concludes by drawing on the work of Besters 2019 corporate social responsibility framework, explicitly developed for mining companies. The framework can help the formal sector mitigate the risks that artisanal mining poses to formal mining operations and the formal workforce. Moreover, the framework provides practical initiatives that could facilitate artisanal mining regulation, improve artisanal miners working conditions, and improve women and childrens safety in the sector. Developing the artisanal mining sector in this manner can create broader opportunities for members of historically disadvantaged communities to benefit from the rich mineral resources of South Africa.", "Global demand for metals is expected to continue to grow significantly to 2050, partly driven by the need for climate change mitigation measures that require energy transition metals including platinum group metals (PGMs). The environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks of mining these metals are seldom acknowledged in energy transition scenarios and pose a risk to future metal supply. Multiple ESG drivers at different scales create direct and indirect pressures and risks to a specific mine site and their interactions across scales create complex system dynamics. Although mining companies identify ESG factors as their biggest risks (and opportunities), interdisciplinary mining research is in its infancy and ESG factors are often oversimplified or overlooked. While global studies are important for providing an overview of the industry, and highlighting trends and patterns, they cannot communicate the complexity found at the local scale. This paper describes ESG risks, opportunities, and impacts across nine dimensions (water, energy, biodiversity, waste, air quality, community, social vulnerability, land use, and governance) for Anglo American Platinums Mogalakwena PGM mine in South Africa. It provides insight into a developing country African context and an in-depth view of the complex ESG risks around PGM mining in South Africa. Given South Africa hosts 91% of global PGM resources, understanding and addressing these ESG risks is critical for ensuring long-term PGM supply and enabling a just energy transition"

Design/methodology/approach This paper provides an insightful exploratory study based on a framework for supply chain financing to accomplish ESG goals that is based on literature review, current policies and practitioner\s observations. Findings With this paper, the authors have started the journey to discuss the importance to look at the social side of supply chain with a goal to attain and fulfill the ESG objectives and discuss different methodologies that can be deployed to translate qualitative information into quantitative data for ESG purposes. Research limitations/implications The research focuses on the growing legal and regulatory focus on organizations to address the adverse impacts their supply chains have on environmental, social and governance ("ESG") related issues. This research has brought in light methods to measure social impact within the supply chain that will help to accelerate the ESG objectives. A global lens will provide a holistic view of the ESG framework. Practical implications The social responsibility framework for supply chain financing and identified methodologies will facilitate managerial decision making that will expedite the integration of "S" in the ESG. Originality/value This research highlights the criticality of looking at social aspects in ESG. The research also presents a social responsibility framework for supply chains to accomplish ESG goals., "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant risks and challenges to businesses. In order to restore the supply chain, this paper incorporates social, environmental, and governance (ESG) factors into the study of corporate supply chains. The aim is to explore the factors that influence supply-chain resilience and performance from these three perspectives, with a particular focus on the role of willingness to adopt green innovation technologies. To encompass a wider audience and multiple industry sectors, this study employs a questionnaire survey method, targeting managers of Chinese companies, and utilizes analytical tools such as SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 26.0 for data analysis and validation. The research findings indicate that supply-chain collaboration, supply-chain management capabilities, supply-chain risks, and green-product innovation have a positive impact on a firms willingness to adopt innovative technologies, subsequently leading to positive effects on supply-chain resilience and performance. By incorporating ESG factors into the scope of supply-chain research, this study expands the research domain and scope of ESG. Additionally, enhancing corporate social responsibility awareness and sustainable development consciousness holds great significance for the recovery of enterprise supply-chain development. This study also offers new insights for businesses to enhance their supply-chain management.", Supply chain resilience is an important topic, defined as the ability of a fractured supply chain to rebuild itself, maintain stability in response to changes in the external environment. This study explores the impact of supply chain ESG management on supply chain resilience. In this paper, a total of 371 questionnaires were collected from Chinese firms, and a PLS-based structural equation model was constructed for empirical testing. This study reveals the positive impact of supply chain ESG management on supply chain resilience. Information network capability mediates the relationship between supply chain ESG management and supply chain resilience. The application of emerging IT technologies positively moderates the impact of supply chain ESG governance on supply chain network capability. This study provides a novel perspective that contributes to the understanding of the importance of supply chain ESG governance in improving supply chain resilience, offers empirical evidence for the role of information network capabilities and emerging IT technologies.

Drawing upon congruence theory, this paper explores the impact of ESG performance congruence among different supply chain members on both firm financial constraints and market value. This study employs response surface analysis and cluster analysis to examine the data of Chinese listed firms and their supply chains from 2009 to 2022. From the dyadic perspective of customer-supplier, the results suggest that the congruence of customer and supplier ESG performance reduces customers financial constraints while increasing suppliers financial constraints. The reduction in customers financial constraints enhances customers firm value. This study further reveals different configuration patterns of ESG performance within the supply chain from the triadic perspective of customer-focal firm-supplier. Our findings enrich the empirical research on ESG performance within supply chains, offering significant insights for managers and investors in allocating supply chain resources and formulating ESG investment strategies.", "Climate change is a major global risk and a key driver for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Yet, firms internal emissions reduction may create a leakage leading to higher emissions in the supply chain. The related literature suggests that the pollution-haven hypothesis explains such emissions leakage. In contrast, we explore an alternative reason for supply chain leakage, which is related to optimization of supply chain activities and supply chain innovation. Based on panel data from Bloomberg Environmental, Social, and Governance and Bloomberg Supply Chain, we estimate our models at a dyadic (i.e., firm and supplier) level using two-way cluster-robust standard error, treating various sources of endogeneity. We find empirical evidence of a supply chain leakage effect-a higher level of a suppliers emissions is associated with a lower level of a firms internal emissions. More importantly, the suppliers innovation can be a major reason behind the leakage; the supply chain leakage effect is stronger when a supplier is more innovative. Furthermore, the role of innovation is strengthened when a supplier invests in eco-innovation and has technological capabilities similar to those of the focal firm. Our findings suggest that supply chain leakage may not be completely driven by the pollution-haven effect, but instead is associated with supply chain optimization and innovation that may be beneficial in the long run.", "An emerging body of work acknowledges the challenges focal firms face in gathering material information about their extended supply chains and begins to point to the role of supply chain structure in influencing supply chain transparency. Still, large-scale empirical evidence on this complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain transparency in the context of the collective public environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firms customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency."

This study seeks to fill this gap by examining the effect of ERM on the GG of oil and gas (O&G) companies in Malaysia.Design/methodology/approachThe study used panel data regression models to analyze panel data from 2012 to 2021. For computing GG, we adapted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments (OECD) GG framework. ERM is computed using COSO and WBCSD guidelines for ESG-related risks. Weighted content analysis is used to measure ERM and GGFindingsThe findings derived from the content and descriptive statistics analyses indicate a consistent and ongoing rise in the adoption of ERM practices over time. However, some companies are still in the initial stages of incorporating ERM to address ESG risks. The studys findings unequivocally establish a substantial and positive relationship between ERM and GG. ERM drives GG by significantly influencing its environmental and resource productivity dimensions. The study further reveals that the impact of ERM on economic opportunities and policy responses, as well as the natural asset base, is statistically significant, albeit with relatively lower coefficient values.Practical implicationsTo enhance the legitimacy of organizations and foster positive stakeholder relationships, regulators, governments, and policymakers should actively promote the adoption of ERM standards that specifically address ESG risks, as outlined by COSO and WBCSD. This strategic alignment with risk management practices will ultimately contribute to improving green growth for organizations.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study examining ERMs effect on GG. The study adds to the existing literature by focusing on ERMs role in a companys GG. It clarifies ERMs significant effect on diminishing emerging ESG risks and advancing GG", Purpose- Used clothes supply chains are becoming increasingly complex, fragmented and less transparent due to rising volumes of discarded clothes and its dispersed reverse logistics operations across the Global North (GN) and Global South (GS). While it has a promising impact on circular economy and international trade growth, increasing exports of used clothes and overflowing landfills raise some negative concerns on its overall sustainability. This paper addresses the dichotomy that exists in terms of interpreting the sustainability credentials of used clothes supply chains.Design/methodology/approach- A systematic literature review was carried out and 55 articles were examined to identify the triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability impacts of used clothes supply chains. TBL sustainability issues were identified, reflected through the lens of natural resource-based view and interpreted in the form of propositions.Findings- The paper pinpoints seven TBL sustainability concerns and prescribes three sets of strategic resources required in glocal used clothes supply chains for mitigating these. These are (1) slowing the supply chain by tackling poor quality, overproduction and oversupply issues, (2) improving logistics/supply chain infrastructure and ecosystem collaboration and (2) embedding transparent environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures taken by both value chain actors and regulatory bodies, for embracing system-level sustainable development.Originality/value- This is one of the first studies to analyse TBL sustainability of glocal north-south used clothes supply chains. The study is unique in terms of its scope and contribution to the sustainable supply chain literature., Purpose This paper aims to answer these questions: "Is the public adopting energy-saving and water-saving facilities because they want to save energy and water in their psychological perception?", "Is it convenient to use energy-saving and water-saving facilities?", "If the inductive design of energy-saving and water-saving facilities attracts the public\s interest, the public is it more willing to install energy-saving and water-saving facilities in a widespread manner?" and "Can inductive energy-saving and water-saving facilities be introduced into the smart manufacturing system of manufacturing industries that require a lot of water to effectively save water and save costs for the company?". Design/methodology/approach This paper aims to investigate the attitudes of employees toward using energy-saving and water-saving facilities by constructing a questionnaire based on the ABC (Affect, Behavior, Cognition) model to survey the attitudes of employees from the Southern and Eastern of Taiwan and establishing a structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relationship between affect, behavior and cognition while using energy-saving and water-saving facilities. Findings There are some findings in this paper that the affective design have a strongly significant positive impact for using energy-saving and water-saving facility in the proposed model. People are willing to use energy-saving and water-saving facilities but are more willing to adopt those energy-saving and water-saving products of smart designs, as those take into account the emotional factors. The critical factor for the public to adopt energy-saving and water-saving facilities is smart design, which incorporates emotional elements. Research limitations/implications There are still some limitations of this study that the ABC model can only be used as a psychological discussion, and the development and design of related facilities still needs to be jointly developed with professionals in related technical fields. The introduction of induction water supply facilities needs to be considered while the company introduces the design of the smart manufacturing system. Therefore, professionals related to induction water supply should participate in the planning at the initial stage of the company\s concept of introducing the smart manufacturing system. Practical implications On the practical side, based on preliminary research conclusions, this study proposes to introduce inductive water supply into smart manufacturing systems for manufacturing companies that require a lot of water in their manufacturing processes. In practice, the company can actually save a lot of water, thereby saving costs and reducing waste water discharge. Social implications The results of this study show that the public has a cognition of energy-saving and water-saving. However, there is a Chinese proverb that "easy to know and hard to do", when actually using facilities, convenience is an important consideration for public. Smart facilities of energy-saving and water-saving, in addition to the benefits of energy-saving and water-saving, it is easy to use, and interacts with users through inductive water supply, which can more emotionally attract people\s willingness to use. Originality/value This study found that smart facilities, which can more emotionally attract people\s willingness to use. On the academic side, this study proves that using the ABC theory to explore the public\s psychological affective, behavior and cognition response to the use of facilities is a very suitable method. On the practical side, based on preliminary research conclusions, this study proposes to introduce inductive water supply into smart manufacturing systems for manufacturing companies that require a lot of water in their manufacturing processes. In practice, the company can actually save a lot of water, thereby saving costs and reducing waste water discharge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Whilst the RI sector is growing, there is limited understanding of the extent to which pressing social issues, such as obesity and unhealthy population diets, are incorporated within RI decision making. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which obesity prevention and population nutrition are considered by Australian institutional investors engaged in responsible investment. Methods A desk-based review was conducted of investment approaches of prominent Australian asset managers and superannuation funds identified as engaged in responsible investment. Relevant information on the incorporation of ESG issues related to obesity and population nutrition was extracted for each investor, drawing on websites, published policy documents and annual reports. Strategies were categorized as: (1) negative/exclusionary screening; (2) positive/best-in-class screening; (3) norms-based screening; (4) ESG integration; (5) sustainability-themed investing; (6) impact/community investing; and (7) corporate engagement and shareholder action. These strategies were compared across investors and by themes related to obesity and population nutrition. Results Eighteen of the 35 investors indicated that they applied investment strategies that considered issues related to obesity and population nutrition. The most commonly identified strategy was ESG integration (n = 12), followed by sustainability-themed investing (n = 6), and positive screening (n = 4). The ways in which obesity and population nutrition were considered as part of these approaches included relatively high-level general health considerations (n = 12), considerations around the healthiness of food company product portfolios (n = 10), and consideration of specific company nutrition policies and practices (n = 4). The specificity and depth to which RI strategies were disclosed varied. Conclusion There is significant potential for investment decisions to contribute to efforts to address key social issues, such as obesity and unhealthy diets. Some institutional investors in Australia have recognized the potential importance of incorporating obesity- and population nutrition-related issues into decision-making processes. However, the extent to which these considerations translate into investment decisions and their impact on companies in the food sector warrant further exploration., Introduction: Institutional investors have considerable potential to positively contribute to shifts towards healthier, more sustainable food systems. However, food systems issues are not systematically taken into account by investors as part of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. This study aimed to identify current approaches to investment decision making regarding food systems issues and ways to facilitate increased consideration of food systems issues as part of investment decision-making in Australia. Methods: We conducted focus groups (15 participants) supplemented by in-depth interviews (19 participants) with financial sector and related civil society stakeholders. Data was thematically analysed, guided by an investment decision-making framework. Results: Participants saw opportunity to include food systems issues as part of investment decision-making processes, including screening, engagement and divestment. Greater investor action could be accelerated by a clear investment case for action; cohesive metrics and reporting; and strong advocacy and coalition building. Conclusion: Holistic incorporation of food systems issues as part of ESG considerations has substantial potential to drive positive food systems transformation., "Background: There is growing recognition that current food systems are both unhealthy and unsustainable, and are increasingly shifting toward the supply and marketing of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods and beverages. Large food companies hold substantial power within food systems and present a significant barrier to progress on addressing issues related to nutrition and obesity prevention. Institutional investors (such as pension funds) play a key role in influencing corporate governance and practices, and are increasingly incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations within investment decisions. By considering nutrition and obesity prevention, institutional investors present a potential avenue for driving increased food industry accountability for their population health impact. This study investigated views of stakeholders in the Australian investment sector on the incorporation of nutrition and obesity prevention considerations within institutional investment decision-making regarding food companies. Methods: Fifteen in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2020-21. Participants were predominantly Australian-based, and included representatives from asset management companies, superannuation funds, ESG advisory/consultancy firms, ESG research providers, and relevant advocacy groups. Interviews examined challenges and opportunities to the integration of nutrition and obesity prevention considerations within institutional investment decision-making. Interviews were analysed using deductive thematic analysis, informed by a theoretical change model. Results: Several participants reported that their institution factored nutrition and obesity prevention considerations into their investment decisions; however, attention to nutrition-related issues was limited, generally perceived as niche, and not yet institutionalised. Key challenges and opportunities were identified at the employee, investment organisation, investment sector, government and non-government levels. These challenges and opportunities centred around experience and knowledge, quality and availability of ESG data and benchmarks, importance of investor coalitions, and demonstration of financial risks related to nutrition and obesity. Conclusion: There are a range of steps that could be taken to help ensure more systematic and effective consideration of issues related to nutrition and obesity prevention within institutional investment decision-making in Australia, including: (1) improved nutrition-related reporting metrics and benchmarking criteria for food companies; (2) better articulation of the financial risks that unhealthy diets and obesity pose to investors; (3) enhanced investor advocacy on unhealthy diets and obesity through investor coalitions and; (4) detailed guidance for investors on how to address unhealthy diets and obesity. Better engagement between the Australian public health community, institutional investors and government regulators is critical to drive changed investor practice in this area."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Using a large, balanced set of panel data from 3881 companies in China from 2009 to 2021, we uncover the following significant associations. (i) A positive relationship exists between institutional investors and ESG performance, which holds after considering potential endogeneity problems and conducting a series of robustness tests. (ii) Specifically, institutional investors affect firms ESG performance by enhancing their ESG strengths, improving their ESG weaknesses, and encouraging them to be more green. (iii) Institutional investors also influence firms ESG performance positively through voicing and exit threats, although they may have a negative influence in the presence of collusion; however, we find no support for the soft activism mechanism by site visiting. (iv) The positive effect of institutional investors on ESG performance is more pronounced for stable and independent institutional investors, firms whose industries are not heavy polluters, and firms with worse corporate governance than for their counterparts. (v) Finally, financial returns motivate institutional investors to improve firms ESG performance.", "Heterogeneous institutional investors shareholding preferences have been driven to change by the deepening of ESG investment philosophy. Therefore, we examine the impact of corporate ESG performance on institutional investors shareholding preferences and its mechanism of action. We conduct mixed OLS and mediation effect tests using data on ESG responsibility scores and institutional investors shareholding ratios of A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2020 as samples. We find that corporate ESG performance can significantly and robustly increase institutional investors shareholdings; the mediation effect analysis shows that overall corporate ESG performance contributes to increases in corporate book and market values, thus encouraging institutional investors to increase their shareholdings. The heterogeneity analysis shows that independent institutional investors attach more importance to corporate ESG responsibility performance, and long-term institutional investors attach more importance to corporate environmental performance; moreover, institutional investors have more significant ESG shareholding preferences for Chinese SOEs. Our study can strengthen the encouragement of institutional investors to integrate ESG investment concepts from multiple perspectives, such as research and analysis, portfolio management, risk control, and due diligence management, to design and develop targeted ESG investment tools, give full play to the role of shareholders and guide the sound development of listed companies from the perspective of investment strategy objectives.", This paper assesses whether qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs) and domestic institutional investors in China drive the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of firms. We first show that QFII ownership is positively associated with future ESG performance but that domestic institutional ownership is not. We then examine the effect of the increase in QFII investment funds on the decision of domestic institutional investors to drive ESG. We find that with the increase in QFII investment funds, domestic institutional investors start to promote firms to improve future ESG performance, especially domestic institutional investors who have held shares of one same firm as QFIIs at the same time. In particular, funds and security funds are affected by QFIIs, and the effect of institutional ownership is stronger in the ESG categories of corporate governance, workforce diversity and product quality. Overall, our results suggest that QFIIs motivate Chinese institutional investors to drive ESG.

However, the uncertainty created by ESG disagreements has caused market participants to question their reliability. This study empirically examines how ESG disagreements affect stock price crash risk based on data from Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies. We find that ESG disagreement significantly reduces stock price crash risk and that this relationship is largely driven by environmental disagreement. The mechanism analysis suggests that ESG disagreement increases media attention, subsequently leading to a reduction in stock price crash risk. Additional analysis shows that the driving effect of environmental disagreement is more significant in non-heavy-polluting industries. Positive environmental protection policies help reduce stock price crash risk., This paper investigates whether corporate performance measured from three aspects-environmental, social responsibility and governance ("ESG")-are associated with stock price crash risk, and also examines how the relation between ESG ratings and stock price crash risk is affected by the degree of financial constraint. Our empirical results show that ESG ratings reduce the stock price crash risk, and this relation is significantly alleviated for financially constrained firms. The results imply that greater financial constraint suppresses the positive role of corporate social responsibility in mitigating the risk of a stock price crash., ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) is gradually becoming one of the essential indicators for evaluating companies. This paper empirically tested the impact of corporate ESG performance on the stock price crash risk. We discover that the better the ESG performance, the lower the likelihood of a stock price crash. These findings remain after a series of robustness tests such as replacing variables, changing parameter estimation methods, controlling for exogenous shocks, propensity score matching and instrumental variables. Corporate ESG per-formance mitigates stock price crash risk by boosting green investor attention, improving analyst competency, and reining management behavior. The effect of ESG performance on stock price crash risk is more significant when the city where the firm is located pays less attention to environmental protection and the large degree of marketization. Compared with the central region of China, the ESG performance of firms in the eastern and western regions has a more significant role in mitigating stock price crash risk.

While previous studies have explored linear associations, the potential for nonlinear dynamics and the role of contextual factors have been largely overlooked. This study addresses this gap by investigating the nonlinear relationship between EPU and ESG performance, considering the moderating effects of regional marketization, industry competition, and managerial green perception. Using a comprehensive dataset of Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2022, we employ quantitative methods including baseline regression analysis, robustness tests, and heterogeneity analysis across different stages of the firm lifecycle. Our findings reveal an inverted Ushaped relationship between EPU and ESG performance, indicating that moderate levels of EPU encourage ESG engagement, while excessive uncertainty leads to declined practices. Furthermore, we find that regional marketization, industry competition, and managerial green perception significantly moderate this relationship, with regional factors exerting the strongest influence. These results contribute to the advancement of theoretical frameworks in sustainable finance and offer valuable insights for managers and policymakers navigating the complex interplay between economic uncertainty and corporate sustainability in diverse contexts., Purpose This paper aims to investigate the nonlinear relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Design/methodology/approach This paper uses panel regression techniques to examine a sample consisting of UK-listed non-financial companies during 2000-2018. Findings The authors found that EPU increases corporate social responsibility which suggests that firms become more socially proactive during the period of heightened EPU. Such countermeasure enhances CSP and is likely a part of a competitive strategy and an insurance mechanism to protect firms against uncertainty in long-term. Further analysis shows a nonlinear relationship between the two factors, suggesting that in a heightened uncertain business environment, the insurance benefit generated by CSP is neutralised by the corresponding cost and, therefore, the positive relationship between EPU and CSP reverses. Originality/value This paper is the first to find a nonlinear relationship between CSP and EPU, indicating that too much uncertainty in macroeconomic policies deteriorates the benefits of CSP to the point that the CSP - EPU relationship becomes negative. The results suggest that policy uncertainty has both the bright side and the dark side where too many cooks eventually spoil the broth., Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) has a significant effect on firm decisions, especially corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure. This research examines the impact of EPU on corporate ESG disclosure, and tests whether this effect can be influenced by financing constraints and internal control using a sample of A-share listed firms in China from 2011 to 2019. The empirical results show that EPU positively affects corporate ESG disclosure. The positive impact of EPU on ESG disclosure is stronger at higher levels of financing constraints and internal control. The heterogeneity analysis further reveals that the positive effect of EPU on corporate ESG disclosure is more significant in state-owned enterprises, heavily polluting firms and those with a higher degree of marketization and industry competition. In times of rising EPU, firms will actively disclose ESG information to mitigate business management risks and reduce negative economic benefits.

We answer this question by studying the impact of geopolitical conflict of a country on the ESG performance, separately and collectively, of firms of that country. We use data from Refinitiv and UCDP/PRIO (Uppsala Conflict Data Program/International Peace Research Institute, Oslo) databases for the period from 2002 to 2021 for 79 countries and we use fixed effects regression as our main methodology. We find that if a country is in a geopolitical conflict, their firms are impacted in the form of lower E, S and G performance and overall ESG performance, with stronger effects for developed countries. This comes on top of the direct costs of geopolitical conflicts. Our results are robust to country, year and firm fixed effects as well as robust to endogeneity as we use Lewbel (2012) estimator to eliminate any chances of endogeneity. We provide first evidence on this topic and it has geopolitical and socioeconomical implications., As climate change and geopolitical conflicts intensify, understanding how geopolitical risks affect companies prioritizing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices is crucial. This study investigates the dynamic relationship between global geopolitical risks and the performance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and non-ESG companies, particularly their influence on green markets. Utilizing a robust methodological framework, including the dynamic time-varying parameters vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model, and causal impact modeling, we analyze daily financial data from 2021 to 2024. The results reveal a substantial negative impact of geopolitical risks on non-ESG companies, contrasting with the resilience of ESGcommitted counterparts. This suggests that ESG-committed companies demonstrate better resilience against geopolitical risks, emphasizing the protective role of ESG practices amid uncertainties. Additionally, the inclusion of ESG companies in green markets diminishes the severity of the negative impact of geopolitical risks, underlining the transformative role of ESG commitment in shaping investor behavior towards sustainable investments. Our findings offer insights for policymakers and investors navigating geopolitical risks and ESG performance, with a focus on environmental management, and provide guidance for effective risk mitigation and investment policies to enhance environmental sustainability., This study investigates the impact of geopolitical risk on firm-level environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Using a news-based indicator of geopolitical risk across 41 countries and a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2002 to 2021 with 65,354 firm-year observations, we uncover that geopolitical risk is negatively associated with ESG performance. Our findings remain robust even when considering alternative measures of geopolitical risk, ESG components, and sub-samples. Moreover, we address potential endogeneity concerns through two-stage least squares, propensity score matching and entropy balancing approaches. Interestingly, we find that the effect of geopolitical risk is positive for countries with lower geopolitical risk and high peace, indicating that relatively stable environments can incentivize firms to enhance their sustainability practices. We also examine the potential channel effects of cash holding, corporate investment, and cost of capital, and found significant effects. Overall, this paper underscores the significance of geopolitical risk as a macro-level shock that significantly influences ESG performance.

We have a natural setting in the COVID-19 era to see if the market rewards family-run firms that integrate social and environmental concerns into their goals during uncertain times. Since they can enhance their image and reputation, which the market values, these companies are likely to pursue broader social objectives, such as environmental improvement (socioemotional wealth perspective); alternatively, managers can act as stewards of the family\s interests by using these initiatives to increase the company\s value (stewardship perspective). However, it is also possible that in this type of companies economic interests prevail over social wellness ("amoral familism"). Therefore, family-owned firms could be reluctant to implement ESG practices unless they yield certain socioemotional benefits, including enhancing or maintaining their reputation in the public eye. In light of the above, we use an international display of the 500 biggest family firms in the world from 2015 to 2021. Taking into account an endogenous relationship between ESG performance and family business value, the study uses generalized moments to construct a dynamic panel (GMM). The primary conclusion is that there is a positive correlation between corporate valuation and ESG performance. Nonetheless, it has been noted that the performance of the companies is negatively impacted during the COVID-19 period. However, for firms with superior ESG performance, this negative impact did not exist over this period, supporting the idea that investors view better ESG performance as a prediction of future good stock performance. The results have a variety of implications. To begin with, this study adds to the body of knowledge on the environmentally friendly and sustainable expansion of family companies by providing recommendations for investors and businesses to better understand the influence of ESG on the profitability of family businesses. Furthermore, managers have to concentrate on enhancing the ESG performance of their organizations as it has the potential to increase value, draw in investments, encourage sustainability, control risks, affect earnings, and interact with the ownership structure. Additionally, managers need to consider how important it is to have a strong ESG performance in order to mitigate the negative effects of external crises like the COVID-19 epidemic. It\s crucial to remember that the precise impact might change based on the sector and other aspects unique to each company., Manuscript TypeEmpirical Research Question/IssueWe investigate the impact of family equity holdings on three indicators of corporate social responsibility: environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rankings. We further evaluate how firm governance mediates the effect of family ownership on environmental and social improvements and how national governance systems influence the response of family holdings to ESG. Research Findings/InsightsBased on a sample of 23,902 firm-year observations drawn from 2002 to 2012 covering 46 countries and 3,893 firms, our findings show that both closely held equity and family ownership are negatively associated with ESG performance. When we control for governance, closely held equity is no longer associated with environmental and social rankings, but family ownership retains a significant negative association. These results are strong and consistent across liberal market economies (LME), whereas coordinated market economies (CME) exhibit generally weaker results and considerable diversity. Japan stands out as different from the other countries examined in depth. Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur results are consistent with agency relationships driving decisions concerning ESG commitment in LMEs. They also emphasize the role of institutional differences given the weak and variable association between ownership and ESG in CMEs. We show that families may be able to influence decisions, possibly through participation in management, despite normally effective governance constraints. As the impact of ownership and governance varies across economies and ownership type, this implies that both agency and governance should be evaluated in the context of the economic environment. Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsOur results offer insights to regulators and policy makers who intend to improve ESG performance. The results suggest that encouraging diversified ownership is particularly important in LMEs, that improvements in governance may benefit social and environmental performance where equity is closely held by institutions, but that governance may be less effective in the presence of family ownership., "Sluggish market demand can deteriorate the financial situation of a company and affect a shareholders decision to adopt environmental, social, and governance criteria (ESG). According to the socioemotional wealth theory, family firms place significant emphasis on sustainable development and long-term orientation, but this emphasis can be either internally or externally driven according to the type of involvement chosen by the owning family. Therefore, this study uses listed family firms to explore the relationship between different types of family involvement (i.e., family ownership and control, the influence of market competition, and the institutionalisation level of the environment in which a firm decides to pursue ESG criteria). We performed a multivariate regression analysis on a sample of 1,151 Chinese companies to test these relationships and found that both family ownership and control are positively related to ESG scores. Market competition negatively moderates the influence of both family ownership and control on the adoption of ESG criteria. Moreover, the influence of family control is negatively moderated by the institutional environment. Thus, types of family involvement seem to be relevant for the firms engagement with ESG criteria."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

We establish that strong ESG disclosure boosts stock liquidity in the Chinese stock market during 2011-2020. Empirical results extend signaling theory and reputation theory by providing evidence that ESG disclosure can be regarded as an extra positive signal and help build the firm reputation via institutional investor preference channel and risk alleviation channel. Cross-sectional analysis using industry classifications demonstrate that the stock liquidity of firms in most service section is not signif-icantly affected by ESG disclosure. And further analysis has shown that the positive impact of ESG disclosure is more pronounced for non-SOEs and firms in Midwest. Our baseline results are robust to DID-analysis and other tests. These findings help investors and firms better understand the role of ESG disclosure and provide insights for them., While stock liquidity has long been a vital consideration in stock markets, environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance has become a growing consideration due to its numerous benefits to companies and society. However, there is limited research on whether corporate motivations to engage in ESG activities affect stock liquidity. We examine this relationship in the context of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by studying the role of three motivations (strategic, altruism, or greenwashing) for company engagement in ESG activities in explaining stock liquidity. We also examine the role of sustainability committees in explaining stock liquidity. Using companies included in the S&P &P ASX 300 from 2009 to 2018, a positive association is found between stock liquidity and a strategic motivation for environmental and social engagement and sustainability committee presence. An unexpected finding is that sustainability committee formation can mislead investors to reward a greenwashing motivation by improving stock liquidity. These findings provide valuable new insights into motives to engage particularly with the "E" and "S" in ESG and sustainability committees\ role in improving stock liquidity., "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is changing from a concept to corporate soft power. Can this improve corporate performance in capital markets? There is little literature linking environmental, Social, and Governance performance to stock liquidity. Therefore, It is of urgent theoretical and practical importance to study the impact of environmental, Social, and Governance performance on stock liquidity. Using Chinese A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2020 as a sample to empirically examine the impact of environmental, Social, and Governance performance on stock liquidity and its mechanism. We find that environmental, Social, and Governance performance has a significant positive impact on listed companies stock liquidity. This conclusion was validated after conducting a series of robustness tests. Mechanism analysis shows that environmental, Social, and Governance performance can promote stock liquidity by reducing agency costs, increasing the proportion of foreign ownership, and improving corporate reputation. The heterogeneity analysis shows that environmental, Social, and Governance performance in state-owned enterprises, heavily polluting enterprises, and enterprises in areas with low degrees of marketisation has a more significant positive promoting effect on stock liquidity. This study expands the research on environmental, Social, and Governance performance and has implications for promoting the development of environmental, Social, and Governance practices."

In the face of escalating climate change risks, investors are seeking strategies to safeguard their portfolios. Building on a growing literature that combines textual analysis and dynamic hedging approach, we propose a method to construct portfolios of publicly traded assets that dynamically hedge climate change risk in the Norwegian stock market. As climate risk is not directly observable, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract news on climate change from more than 400,000 articles published in the Norwegian newspaper Dagens N ae ringsliv between January 2013 and February 2022. Using these data, we develop the DN Climate Change News Index and use innovations in this index as a hedge target. The hedge portfolios are constructed using third-party environmental scores from MSCI and Sustainalytics, along with firm-level data of equities listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The DN Climate Change News Index show high correlations with international counterparts, indicating its ability to capture major global climate events and assessing the intensity of climate change-related news coverage. However, despite a positive out-of-sample correlation, the mimicking portfolio approach fails to construct efficient hedge portfolios against innovations in the index. Hedge portfolios based on Sustainalytics E-scores show a 0.21 out-of-sample correlation with innovations in the DN Climate Change News Index, indicating that the index may provide a relevant signal for investors., "Under its climate regulation, the EU is expected to become the first continent with a net-zero emissions balance. We study the pricing of climate risks, physical and transition, within European markets. Using text-analysis, we construct two novel (daily) physical and transition risk indicators for the period 2005-2021 and two global climate risk vocabularies. Applying our climate risk indices to an asset pricing test framework, we document the emergence of economically significant transition and physical risk premia post-2015. From a firm-level analysis, using firms GHG emissions, GHG emissions intensity, environmental, and ESG scores, we find that rises in transition (physical) risk are typically associated with an increase (decrease) in the return of green (brown) stocks. Firm-level information is used by investors to proxy firms climate-risks exposure, especially for transition risk since 2015, whereas the sectoral classification appears to proxy firms exposures to physical risk. From a country-level analysis emerges an intensified connection between European stock markets and climate risks post-2015, yet with some heterogeneity. Our results have important economic implications and show that investors demand compensation for their exposure to both climate risk types. Our novel climate risk vocabularies and indicators find several applications in identifying, measuring, and studying climate risks.", "Countries have set varying targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreements goal of keeping the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees C. In this article, the authors examine to what extent climate risk has been priced into equity markets and whether climate change can be modeled using a typical risk model structure. They develop the fundamental economic transmission channels to explain the potential impact of climate change on equity prices, including empirical evidence for climate policies and green technology as financial risk drivers. They also study the impact of climate-transition risk on valuation levels and trends. They conclude with a discussion of how to measure and categorize companies climate-risk exposures and how to integrate climate-transition risks into risk models."

Based on public company data from 2011 to 2022, this study explores the causal relationship between climate risk exposure (CRE) and ESG performance by using a two-way fixed effect mode. The results indicate that CRE significantly enhances firms ESG performance, which makes improvements in environmental practices. The impact of the promotion is particularly pronounced in state-owned and low-polluting businesses. In addition, it can improve ESG through potential impact channels, such as employing environmental executives, improving environmental protection, and boosting green innovation. Meanwhile, the digital level and financing constraints of enterprises play an effective moderating role. Further discussion shows that the increase in CRE has prompted firms to fulfill environmental responsibilities and reduce carbon emissions. This study provides new quantitative evidence on how firms respond to climate risk, expanding the existing research on ESG performance. It further examines the specific impact path of climate risk on companies and green transformation and provides more firm-level insights for policymakers to address climate change. These results enrich the theoretical system of climate risk management and help enterprises strengthen awareness of climate risk to cope with sustainable development.", "Industry carbon emissions have been increasing, yet there remains a dearth of research on the impacts of climate policy uncertainty. This study first explored the effects of climate policy uncertainty on the carbon emissions of semiconductor enterprises. We employed the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. We constructed a Chinese climate policy uncertainty index based on electronic news entries to match the enterprise panel data structure from 2011 to 2022. The results showed an increase in climate policy uncertainty, which helped to reduce semiconductor enterprises carbon emissions. This effect was primarily achieved via two pathways. First, climate policy uncertainty leads to companies facing stricter environmental requirements, and these companies will proactively increase their investment in environmental, social, and governance standards to cope with the potential risks. Second, climate policy uncertainty is often accompanied by shifts in government climate policy. Governments will provide green subsidies to enterprises to achieve their policy goals. Furthermore, the policy uncertainty for the semiconductor industry could amplify the reducing effect of climate policy uncertainty on the carbon emissions from semiconductor enterprises. Climate policy uncertainty has a greater impact on non-state-owned and smaller semiconductor enterprises. Our study provides a new way to measure climate policy uncertainty, finds a new perspective based on climate policy uncertainty for exploring the potential impacts of corporate carbon emission reductions, bridges the gap between previous studies on enterprise carbon reductions and climate policy uncertainty, and offers a new path for governments to manage industrial carbon emissions.", "In the context of addressing climate change, the uncertainty of climate policies has intensified the environmental and regulatory risks faced by enterprises, forcing them to adjust their strategies for fulfilling ESG responsibilities in pursuit of sustainable development. This paper uses panel data from listed non-financial enterprises on Chinas Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share markets from 2011 to 2022, employing a fixed-effects panel model to examine the impact of climate policy uncertainty on corporate ESG performance. The findings indicate that climate policy uncertainty significantly hampers the ESG performance of enterprises. The mechanism analysis reveals that climate policy uncertainty negatively affects ESG performance by deepening corporate financing constraints and increasing short-term financial performance. The heterogeneity analysis shows that in terms of ownership structure, the negative impact of climate policy uncertainty on the ESG performance of state-owned enterprises is relatively weaker. In terms of industry heterogeneity, climate policy uncertainty suppresses the ESG performance of enterprises in technology-intensive industries. From a regional perspective, climate policy uncertainty has a stronger inhibitory effect on the ESG performance of enterprises in eastern China. This study provides valuable insights for both national climate policy formulation and corporate efforts to enhance ESG performance."

The AMG, FMOLS, DOLS, and ARDL models are applied. While we found negative impacts of environmental factors (ENVf) on SDGs for Argentina, Ethiopia, and China, we found positive impacts of social factors (SOCf) on SDGs for South Africa and Argentina. Additionally, while we found positive impacts of governance factors (GOVNf) on SDGs for Ethiopia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, we found negative impacts for the United Arab Emirates. No significant relationships were found between ENVf, SOCf, and GOVNf on SDGs for Brazil, Russia, India, and Egypt. These findings highlight the nuanced impacts of ESG factors on SDGs, providing valuable insights for policymakers and emphasizing the need for country-specific sustainable development strategies. The negative environmental impact on SDGs in Argentina, Ethiopia, and China suggests that environmental degradation may hinder sustainable development, underscoring the importance of balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability. This result can also be interpreted through the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, which posits that developing countries may attract more foreign investments in pollution-intensive industries due to their less stringent environmental regulations., "Raising ESG standards and reducing climate policy uncertainty can directly determine CO2 emissions. Therefore, this study examines the effects of economic, social, governance (ECON-SG), and climate policy uncertainty on CO2 emissions (CO2E) on a global scale from 2001 to 2020. The ARDL and ARDL bound tests are employed. The F-statistics suggest a stable long-run relationship among the variables, indicating that the estimated coefficients are robust. Empirical findings reveal that while economic factors increase CO2E, social factors mitigate. Based on these results, the interactions of economic, social, governance, and climate policy with global (total) environmental problems can be interpreted as follows. (i) Energy consumption driven by global economic growth and industrial production based mainly on fossil fuels increases CO2E. This result may also indicate unsustainable economic growth. (ii) Despite unsustainable global economic growth, increasing social awareness, education level, and life expectancy can be interpreted as improving societys environmental awareness and reducing CO2E. Therefore, policymakers must harmonize their global economic and social policies conflicting with CO2E. In fact, this result may indicate that economic growth that does not support and develop social policies cannot positively contribute to the environment because the ultimate point of economic policies and growth is people in social life. (iii) The insignificant impact of climate policy uncertainty on CO2E can be interpreted because of an international lack of coordination in global climate policies.", "Asia-Pacific countries are experiencing rapid economic growth. Is this growth ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors-based and aligned growth? Therefore, this study investigates the connections between ESG indicators and economic growth in East Asia Pacific and South Asia. To achieve this aim, we employed the FMOLS, DOLS, and AMG models. While the AMG model highlights significant long-term positive effects of the environmental (EFs) and governance factors (GOVNF) on economic growth, the FMOLS and DOLS models emphasize the substantial influence of social factors (SOC) on economic growth. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ESG factors and offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align strategies with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Notably, the GOVNF, with components like control of corruption, regulatory quality, rule of law, and government effectiveness, does not influence the GDP of developed nations, such as Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. However, its significance is evident in countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. This result might stem from the possibility that developed countries have historically addressed and resolved issues like corruption and the rule of law, while these elements remain crucial determinants for the economic growth of developing nations like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Empirical findings provide the regions policymakers with essential insights and a guide for implementing their economic growth policies ESG factor-based and aligned to the United Nations SDGs. These targets will make the economic growth of the regions countries sustainable."

Bangladesh, a key player in the global textile supply chain and one of the top producers, contributes significantly to these emissions. However, accessible data on activity and GHG emissions, crucial for researchers, the private sector, and policymakers in decision-making, is scarce. To address this gap, this study combines a detailed field survey with expert interviews to establish a comprehensive emission inventory. This inventory aims to identify hotspots and facilitate the adoption of effective mitigation strategies. Focusing on a prominent industrial zones textile and readymade garments (RMG) industries, the research employs a mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches and follows the IPCC guidelines to develop a GHG emission inventory for 2022. The study evaluates various emission sources, including scope 1 (onsite fuel combustions), scope 2 (grid electricity usage), and scope 3 (waste and wastewater treatment). In the total emissions (6043.5 Gg CO(2)eq.), textile and RMG industries contribute 67.8% and 32.2%, respectively, with scope 1 emissions dominating at 85%. Notably, scope 2 emissions exhibit significant uncertainty (-10.4% to +11.9%), largely due to variations in national grid emission factors. This study forecasts GHG emissions until 2030, considering current trends (26 thousand Gg CO2 eq.). It also explores various energy mix scenarios, factoring in the depletion of existing natural gas reserves (ranging from 8 thousand to 33 thousand Gg CO2 eq.). This study delves into the impact of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) system on industries GHG emissions. Besides improving worldwide emission databases and identifying hotspots, this research aims to promote a sustainable transition in both Bangladesh and other developing textile manufacturing nations across the globe.", "Carbon management strategies are crucial for businesses to decrease their contribution to climate change. The aviation industry currently contributes 2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. As part of the aviation industry, Qantas Group has enacted ambitious carbon management goals to reduce its carbon emissions. As of the 2020 financial year, the companys Scope 1 emissions are 1,919,212 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions (t CO2-e) and its Scope 2 emissions are 4,642 t CO2-e. The company has reduced its emissions through strategies, such as carbon offsetting, sustainable fuel investment, increasing fuel efficiency and reducing its landfill contribution. The Groups carbon management goals were examined through a framework, which found these goals to be absolute, broad scoped, ambitious, and set over a long- time frame. These are reflective of providing a successful environmental performance and mitigating its climate risk. Although Qantas has made significant progress in its carbon management goals, there is still much to be improved upon and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain to be seen. The Group still requires extensive alterations to its practices to achieve its net-zero emissions goal.", Since the industrial revolution, greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities have posed an unprecedented global challenge to social development and impact on the natural environment. With the growing awareness of environmental protection and the promotion of international cooperation mechanisms, there is a global consensus to control greenhouse gases. In order to avoid irreversible and catastrophic climate change, there is an urgent need for more companies to take action and make credible commitments to combat climate change and carbon reduction goals aligned with the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As one of the largest and most influential international food and beverage companies with a range of well-known brands, PepsiCo has made ambitious commitments to science-based climate goals, including reducing GHG emissions from its direct operations by 75% against the 2015 baseline and reducing GHG emissions across its indirect value chain by 40% by 2030, as well as setting an ambitious new target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. PepsiCo has incorporated carbon reduction and climate strategies in all focus areas across its value chain, accelerating its work on broadening the scale of sustainable agriculture and regenerative farming practice; reducing plastic use and increasing the use of recycle and renewable materials as well as adopting low-carbon alternatives; developing efficient and alternative solutions in transportation and distribution; shifting to renewable electricity and fuels in manufacturing and fleet. Up to 2021, PepsiCo has achieved a 23% of the absolute emissions target of reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and 7.9% of the absolute emissions target of reducing Scope 3 emissions. This research aims to evaluate the performance of PepsiCo on achieving their carbon reduction targets based on the analysis of the reported carbon estimates and reduction strategies, and also provides future strategic suggestions and guidance by adopting case study analysis. Although PepsiCo has reported great progress in reducing carbon emissions, further efforts are needed to achieve these goals.

However, ESG rating disagreement creates a barrier to ESG investment. This study explores empirically how ESG rating disagreement affects the Chinese capital market based on rating data from six agencies. The results show that ESG rating disagreement has a significant negative impact on stock returns. Mechanism analysis indicates that ESG rating disagreement can lead to decreased investor sentiment and, subsequently, a drop in stock returns. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that this negative impact is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, companies with higher average ESG ratings, and those with fewer institutional investors. Moreover, the governance dimension is the crucial factor driving the drop in stock returns. Therefore, investors and decision makers should consider comprehensive information from multiple agencies when assessing ESG ratings to help mitigate decision bias., "This study examines the effect of ESG rating disagreement on analysts earning forecast using a sample consisting of ESG ratings of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2021 by six rating agencies including RSK, SynTao Green Finance, Hexun, Bloomberg, Huazheng and Wind. We find that greater ESG rating disagreement is linked to increased forecast error and dispersion among analysts. The mechanism test confirms that ESG rating disagreement exacerbates information asymmetry, leading to greater forecast inaccuracies and dispersion. Further analysis reveals that the negative impact of ESG rating disagreement is more pronounced in companies with worse information environments, while experienced and diligent analysts, alongside star analysts, can mitigate such negative effect of rating disagreement. Our findings contribute to the literature on ESG rating disagreement from an analysts perspective, providing empirical evidence from emerging capital market about the economic consequences of ESG rating disagreement.", "We assess the level of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating disagreement among Chinese listed companies using ESG data from eight ESG rating providers and examine the impact of ESG rating disagreement on stock price informativeness. Our results indicate a significant and positive correlation between ESG rating disagreement and stock price synchronicity. This suggests that different ESG ratings impede the integration of company-specific details into stock prices, thereby reducing the stock prices informativeness. The opacity of corporate information and agency costs can both be used to interpret this result. We also explore the transmission channels through which ESG rating disagreement affects stock price informativeness. Our findings reveal that such disagreement lowers the quality of analysts predictions and impedes investors access to information, affecting the informativeness of stock prices. Furthermore, we observe that ESG rating disagreement has a greater impact on stock price synchronicity for companies with high ESG ratings and those operating in highly competitive industries. Increased media coverage would mitigate the effect of ESG rating disagreement on stock price synchronicity. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature on ESG rating disagreement and demonstrate the critical role of ESG rating disagreement in the informativeness of stock prices."

The hypotheses were as follows: a strong negative impact on non-financial institutions credit rating changes will result from ESG risk changes, and the reaction of credit rating changes will vary in different sectors. Panel event models were used to verify these hypotheses. The study used data from the Thomson Reuters Database for the period 2010-2020. The analysis was based on the literature on credit rating determinants and on papers and reports on COVID-19, ESG factors, and their impact on credit rating changes. Linear decomposition was used for the analysis. To verify these hypotheses, long-term issuer credit ratings presented by Moodys and Fitch for European companies listed on these stock exchanges have been used. In the analyses, financial and non-financial factors were also considered. The results suggested that, within the last year, the methodology presented by credit rating agencies has changed, and ESG factors are one of the basic measures that are used to verify credit rating changes, especially those related to the pandemic.", Targets defined in accordance with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria confront the business world, particularly the banking industry, with new challenges. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of ESG controversies on the credit rating of the European banking sector, involving 65 European banks from 18 countries in the 2011-2020 period. This empirical study includes different approaches. Firstly, we apply an ordered logit model to ascertain the influence of ESG concerns on credit ratings. Secondly, we analyse the impact of ESG controversies on the probability of obtaining a better rating scale through the marginal effects. And finally, we use matching analysis to measure the real impact of ESG controversies on credit ratings. Our findings suggest that ESG controversies have a negative effect on credit rating. In addition, it is a relevant negative factor in the probability of obtaining a better rating in future reviews of credit assessments. Specifically, the lower the level of ESG controversies, the greater the probability of achieving the highest credit ratings. This research provides a comprehensive view of the impact of ESG controversies on credit ratings awarded to European financial institutions. European banks should take special care to avoid such controversies, as a source of reputational risk, when setting their policies so that their credit ratings would not be affected., The aim this study is to analyze the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) measures on energy sector credit ratings. The main hypothesis is as follows: The ESG measures have had a significant impact on energy sector credit ratings during the COVID-19 crisis. The analysis has been conducted by using long-term issuer credit ratings presented by the main credit rating agencies. To verify the hypothesis, quarterly data from financial statements, macroeconomic data, and ESG measures for all companies listed on the stock exchanges from all over the world for the 2000-2021 period were collected. The sector was divided into sub-samples according to the type of sector and the moment of the COVID-19 crisis. It was noticed that a stronger reaction of credit ratings during the COVID-19 crisis on ESG factors, than that before it, was also observed, and confirms the increasing role of ESG measures in the financial market. On the other hand, credit rating agencies take into consideration ESG factors during the first estimation. Later, the mentioned variables lose their importance. This is based on a few reasons. It is still a small sample of entities that publish non-financial statements connected with ESG. Some countries have yet to implement regulations associated with climate risk. The significance of electricity power consumption and CO2 emissions confirms the significance of the mentioned direct or indirect impact of ESG factors. Credit rating agencies are not willing to change credit ratings because usually companies from the energy sector, especially from coal and oil and gas subsectors, are large entities. They sometimes receive financial support from governments. Governments are also stakeholders that create a lower risk of default. In less developed countries, coal is one of the main energy sources, and costs connected with alternative, renewable energy are more expensive. The prepared research also suggests that particular ESG measures have varying significance on credit ratings. Therefore, it can help to analyze and build models by investors. It will not be without significance for estimating the default risk and the cost of the capital. In most cases, the most significant measure is the E factor.

Results indicate that ESG performance and corporate stability exhibit growth inertia and self-reinforcing mechanisms, with overall ESG performance significantly mitigating default risk. Although no bidirectional causality was found between environmental and governance performance and default risk, corporate stability positively impacts both over time. The findings indicate a synergistic relationship between social performance and default risk, in which strong social performance helps mitigate default risk. Financial stability encourages companies to engage in social responsibility initiatives. Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the mitigating effects of ESG performance on default risk are more pronounced for non-stateowned enterprises (non-SOEs) and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Social responsibility and corporate governance are more significant in enhancing financial stability in manufacturing firms. These findings provide valuable insights for investors and policymakers in mitigating default risks while promoting the development of green finance., "We investigate the implications of ESG practices of Chinese listed firms on their default risk. We explore the relationship between default risk and ESG ratings. Applying year-by-season and firm fixed effects, we find that higher ESG ratings mitigate firms default risk. The mitigation effect increases as the term structure of default risk increases. We find that the magnitude of ESG ratings impact on firms default risk is smaller for manufacturing firms than non-manufacturing firms. Our findings suggest that credit markets well reflect the ESG practices of firms; investors may improve credit risk management by considering the ESG performances of firms.", Focusing on the Korean stock market, this paper expands on previous research on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and default risk. By using a comprehensive sample of 6977 firm-year observations during the 2011-2021 period, we employ the year fixed effects and industrial sector dummies classified by FnGuide Industry Classification Standard to control for shifting economic conditions over time and effects within industries. The Z-score is employed as the primary proxy for default risk, and the finding of the study confirms a negative association between CSR practices and default risk. Moreover, testing the three components of CSR, we also find that each component has a negative impact on the default risk. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we conduct a robustness check using two additional proxies of default risk: the K-score, a specific measure of default risk for the Korean market, and the distance to default (DTD), a market-based model. Our results remain consistent and robust even when utilizing alternative proxies, further confirming the negative relationship between CSR and default risk. This has significant implications for businesses and regulators who aim to decrease the risk of default through implementing CSR initiatives.

Such information can be useful in predictive tasks involving companies. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings of companies are important for assessing the sustainability risks of companies. The process of generating ESG ratings by expert analysts is, however, laborious and time-intensive. We thus explore the use of dynamic multimodal networks extracted from the web for forecasting ESG ratings. Learning such dynamic multimodal networks from the web for forecasting ESG ratings is, however, challenging due to its heterogeneity and the low signal-to-noise ratios and non-stationary distributions of web information. Human analysts cope with such issues by learning concepts from past experience through relational thinking and scanning for such concepts when analyzing new information about a company. In this article, we propose the Dynamic Multimodal Slot Concept Attention-based Network (DynScan) model. DynScan utilizes slot attention mechanisms together with slot concept alignment and disentanglement loss functions to learn latent slot concepts from dynamic multimodal networks to improve performance on ESG rating forecasting tasks. DynScan is evaluated on forecasting tasks on six datasets, comprising three ESG ratings across two sets of companies. Our experiments show that DynScan outperforms other state-of-the-art models on these forecasting tasks. We also visualize the slot concepts learned by DynScan on five synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets and observe distinct and meaningful slot concepts being learned by DynScan across both synthetic and real-world datasets., "Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) rating agencies have been instrumental in mainstreaming sustainability in the investment industry. Traditionally, they have relied on company disclosure and human analysis to produce their ratings. More recently however, technological innovation in data scraping and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have undercut the traditional approach. Tech-driven Alternative ESG ratings are becoming increasingly influential yet remain critically underexplored in sustainable finance scholarship. Grounded within financial geography and using mixed methods, this paper fills this gap by comparing a set of Traditional ratings, sourced from MSCI ESG, with an Alternative AI-based set of ESG ratings sourced from Truvalue Labs. Our results expand upon recent research on ESG ratings by shedding new light on low commensurability between Traditional and Alternative ESG ratings. Specifically, we show that differences in ratings are driven by four main factors: differences in ESG theorisation based on key issue selection, differences in data sources analysed, differences in weighting structures for rating aggregation, and finally differences in controversy analysis. Our findings are contextualised using participatory observations collected during fieldwork at a leading asset manager in the City of London. Overall, we show that the advantages of Alternative ESG ratings include higher levels of standardisation, a transparent outside-in perspective on ratings, a more democratic aggregation process, and rigorous real-time analytics. We argue that these characteristics reflect a geographic reconfiguration of ESG rating construction, expanding from financial agglomerations to technological and digital spaces of innovation. While Alternative ESG ratings make major promises on how technology can reform sustainable investing, we recognise that risks remain.", Environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations play an increasingly important role due to the growing focus on sustainability globally. Entities, such as banks and investors, utilize ESG ratings of companies issued by specialized rating agencies to evaluate ESG risks of companies. The process of assigning ESG ratings by human analysts is however laborious and time intensive. Developing methods to predict ESG ratings could alleviate such challenges, allow ESG ratings to be generated in a more timely manner, cover more companies, and be more accessible. Most works study the effects of ESG ratings on target variables such as stock prices or financial fundamentals of companies, but few works study how different types of company information can be utilized to predict ESG ratings. Previous works also largely focus on using only the financial information of individual companies to predict ESG ratings, leaving out the different types of inter-company relationship networks. Such inter-company relationship networks are typically dynamic, i.e., they evolve across time. In this paper, we focus on utilizing dynamic inter-company relationships for ESG ratings prediction, and examine the relative importance of different financial and dynamic network information in this prediction task. Our analysis shows that utilizing dynamic inter-company network information, based on common director, common investor and news event-based knowledge graph relationships, can significantly improve ESG rating prediction performance. Robustness checks over different time-periods and different number of time-steps in the future further validate these insights.

This study employs green bond issuance as a proxy to measure investors recognition of a firms sustainable activities by linking literature on ESG and financial performance and those on green bond issuance. This study innovatively creates the datasets by combining the ESG performance of Chinese listed companies with their green bond issuance from 2016 to 2020 based on the Wind and CSMAR databases and examines the relationship between the performance of ESG dimensions and green bond issuance from the perspective of listed firms in the emerging market. The results indicate that decent ESG practices not only increase the propensity in green bond issuance by listed firms but also help them issue more green bonds. More specifically, we found evidence to support this finding from every dimension of these sustainable practices. However, this study identified the negative effect of financial performance in issuing green bonds when combining the effect of ESG performance.", "The green bond market has been growing rapidly worldwide since its debut in 2007. We present the first empirical study on the announcement returns and real effects of green bond issuance by firms in 28 countries during 2007-2017. After compiling a comprehensive international green bond dataset, we document that stock prices positively respond to green bond issuance. However, we do not find a consistently significant premium for green bonds, suggesting that the positive stock returns around green bond announcements are not fully driven by the lower cost of debt. Nevertheless, we show that institutional ownership, especially from domestic institutions, increases after the firm issues green bonds. Moreover, stock liquidity significantly improves upon the issuance of green bonds. Overall, our findings suggest that the firms issuance of green bonds is beneficial to its existing shareholders.", "Green bonds have gained prominence on Chinas capital market as tools that help to fuel the transition to a climate-resilient economy. Although the issuance volume on the Chinese green bond market has been growing rapidly in recent years, the impact of the green label on bond pricing has not been studied adequately. Therefore, this paper investigates whether this newly developed financial instrument offers investors in China an attractive yield compared to other equivalent conventional bonds. By matching green bonds with their conventional counterparts and subsequently applying a fixed-effects estimation, our empirical results reveal a significant green bond yield premium of 1.8 basis points (bps) on average on the Chinese secondary market. As compared to Climate Bond Initiative (CBI) certified green bonds, we find that investors are more willing to accept lower yields (pay higher prices) to include Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) certified green bonds into their portfolio management. Thus, we argue that Chinese green investors prefer PBOC certified green bond over CBI certified green bonds on the Chinese market. Driven by pro-environmental preference, investors are also found to be willing to pay a higher price for green bonds issued by environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance-rated issuers. Our results point to some practical implications for investors and policymakers."

Given the sectors significant environmental impact and the current energy transition, it is crucial to understand how ESG disclosure affects financial performance, particularly in terms of debt market dynamics. This research aims to provide empirical evidence on whether ESG efforts by O&G companies influence their cost of borrowing. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a quantitative approach using secondary data from Refinitiv for the period 2018-2022. To address potential endogeneity issues, we utilize two-stage-least-squares regressions. The analysis focuses on corporate bond spreads as the dependent variable and ESG as the key independent variable. Findings - Our findings indicate a negative association between ESG disclosure and corporate bond spreads. Specifically, companies with higher ESG ratings tend to experience lower credit spreads, suggesting that improved ESG practices may lead to reduced borrowing costs. Additionally, the results show that non-state-owned companies (SOC) benefit more from ESG in terms of financial performance compared to state-owned counterparts. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by its reliance on secondary data from Refinitiv, which may not capture all nuances of ESG practices and financial performance. Additionally, the analysis is confined to the O&G industry, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to other sectors. Future research could expand the scope to include other industries and incorporate primary data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ESG-financial performance relationship. Practical implications - The studys findings suggest that O&G companies can potentially reduce their borrowing costs by improving their ESG ratings. This insight is valuable for corporate managers and investors, as it highlights the financial benefits of sustainable practices. Additionally, policymakers could use these findings to encourage better ESG disclosure and practices within the industry, ultimately promoting a more sustainable energy sector. Social implications - By demonstrating the financial advantages of ESG disclosure, this study underscores the broader social benefits of sustainable business practices. Improved ESG ratings not only contribute to environmental and social well-being but also enhance a companys financial performance. This dual benefit can motivate more companies to adopt sustainable practices, leading to positive societal impacts such as reduced environmental damage and improved community relations. Originality/value - This study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate bond credit spreads specifically within the O&G industry. By highlighting the differential impact of ESG disclosure on state-owned versus non-SOC, the research offers unique insights that can inform corporate strategies in the context of sustainability and financial performance.", The growing interest in the financial materiality of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings has prompted recent investigations into their risk pricing impact in the corporate bond market. The specific implications for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry have not been explored, as prior work has primarily focused on broad-based ESG integration. To fill this gap, our study employed an interpretable machine learning technique using a sample universe of U.S. corporate bonds spanning from 2010 to 2021 to estimate the impact of ESG ratings on corporate bond issuance spreads. The results revealed an average ESG benefit of 10 basis points across all sectors. However, it is important to note that the effects of ESG ratings on bond pricing demonstrate variation across sectors and individual ESG constituent ratings. Significantly, our findings show that social and governance ratings emerge as the primary drivers influencing bond issuance costs, whereas the impact of environmental scores is comparatively less significant. Within AEC-related industries, empirical data on the influence of ESG ratings indicate discounted pricing by the market is particularly channeled through environmental and governance scores. These findings emphasize the value-added impact of enhanced ESG performance on the cost of debt financing, presenting a financially material opportunity for operational and management decision-making. By adopting sustainable strategies to improve ESG performance, organizations in the AEC industry can potentially achieve lower costs of debt when issuing bonds to secure financing for construction projects. The managerial implications extend to policymakers, corporate managers, and creditors, as they all stand to benefit from the financial implications of ESG performance., In recent years, as the concept of sustainable development has grown in popularity, ESG has attracted widespread interest from people of all backgrounds. This paper empirically investigates the impact of corporate ESG performance on bond credit spreads using a sample of 988 bonds issued by 443 A-share listed companies from the first quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2020. Results indicate that bond credit spreads are lower for listed companies with higher ESG performance. Good ESG performance decreases bond credit spreads by decreasing corporate financial risk, enhancing corporate transparency, and decreasing debt agency costs. The effect of ESG performance on bond credit spreads is more pronounced for non-state enterprises, enter-prises in poor macroeconomic environments, and enterprises in regions with a higher degree of marketization. This study provides evidence for the positive economic consequences of ESG performance from the perspective of bond financing, with implications for firms to improve ESG performance and bond investors to optimize investment decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Yet, established technology adoption theories offer limited tools for characterizing business AI integration and analyzing its effects. These primarily focus on the factors facilitating or hindering adoption, rather than on adoption patterns and impacts. This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to address this key gap and applies it to the case of the ESG rating industry. ESG raters play a pivotal role in sustainable finance, providing metrics that guide investment decisions globally. However, little is known about the extent and nature of their AI usage and its implications. Through a mixed-methods approach combining the analysis of job postings, patent filings, research publications, and corporate websites, we examine AI adoption among major ESG raters. Our investigation explores the specific AI technologies employed, their functional applications, the innovations developed, the intensity of AI integration, and the potential impacts of raters AI adoption. Our results reveal widespread and growing AI adoption across the industry. Our findings show that raters extensively leverage Natural Language Processing to streamline data collection, processing, and analysis. Furthermore, they have pioneered Machine Learning innovations that significantly expand their sustainability assessment capabilities in various domains. These findings mark a considerable departure from prior academic and gray literature that characterized major ESG raters as having minimal AI use, prompting critical questions regarding the implications of this technological transformation for ESG ratings reliability, transparency, and potential biases.", Artificial intelligence (AI) assurance is an umbrella term describing many approaches-such as impact assessment, audit, and certification procedures-used to provide evidence that an AI system is legal, ethical, and technically robust. AI assurance approaches largely focus on two overlapping categories of harms: deployment harms that emerge at, or after, the point of use, and individual harms that directly impact a person as an individual. Current approaches generally overlook upstream collective and societal harms associated with the development of systems, such as resource extraction and processing, exploitative labour practices and energy intensive model training. Thus, the scope of current AI assurance practice is insufficient for ensuring that AI is ethical in a holistic sense, i.e. in ways that are legally permissible, socially acceptable, economically viable and environmentally sustainable. This article addresses this shortcoming by arguing for a broader approach to AI assurance that is sensitive to the full scope of AI development and deployment harms. To do so, the article maps harms related to AI and highlights three examples of harmful practices that occur upstream in the AI supply chain and impact the environment, labour, and data exploitation. It then reviews assurance mechanisms used in adjacent industries to mitigate similar harms, evaluating their strengths, weaknesses, and how effectively they are being applied to AI. Finally, it provides recommendations as to how a broader approach to AI assurance can be implemented to mitigate harms more effectively across the whole AI supply chain., "Artificial intelligence (AI) governance and auditing promise to bridge the gap between AI ethics principles and the responsible use of AI systems, but they require assessment mechanisms and metrics. Effective AI governance is not only about legal compliance; organizations can strive to go beyond legal requirements by proactively considering the risks inherent in their AI systems. In the past decade, investors have become increasingly active in advancing corporate social responsibility and sustainability practices. Including nonfinancial information related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in investment analyses has become mainstream practice among investors. However, the AI auditing literature is mostly silent on the role of investors. The current study addresses two research questions: (1) how companies responsible use of AI is included in ESG investment analyses and (2) what connections can be found between principles of responsible AI and ESG ranking criteria. We conducted a series of expert interviews and analyzed the data using thematic analysis. Awareness of AI issues, measuring AI impacts, and governing AI processes emerged as the three main themes in the analysis. The findings indicate that AI is still a relatively unknown topic for investors, and taking the responsible use of AI into account in ESG analyses is not an established practice. However, AI is recognized as a potentially material issue for various industries and companies, indicating that its incorporation into ESG evaluations may be justified. There is a need for standardized metrics for AI responsibility, while critical bottlenecks and asymmetrical knowledge relations must be tackled."

The novel wireless AC power monitoring module consists of both ZMPT101B voltage sensor and ACS712-20 current sensor; a 16-bit analog-to-digital (ADC) ADS1114 with (IC)-C-2 interface and WeMos D1 Mini Wi-Fi module were integrated for monitoring refrigerator and air conditioner appliances with the ratings of single-phase 110/220 V-AC, respectively. First, both analog readings of V/I sensors for AC appliances are converted into data streams in compliance with (IC)-C-2 (inter-integrated circuit) protocol, and are forwarded to a WeMos D1 Mini Wi-Fi module for the corresponding values of instantaneous electric power and energy, power factor (pf), and frequency well programmed in the built-in ESP8266EX IoT-based microcontroller unit (MCU) based on the well-known AC power fundamentals. All of the important AC power parameters are sent to the ThingSpeak IoT platform through Wi-Fi network. The visualization of voltage, current, electric power and energy, pf, and frequency is illustrated in the ThingSpeak IoT platform. Both close agreement and confidence of the proposed AC power monitoring IoT system for both refrigerator and air conditioner are evaluated with two CM3286-1 AC Power Meters. Taking the commercialized CM3286-1 instrument as reference, the values of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for above six electrical parameter readings are all less than 2%. The evaluation results illustrate sufficient closeness of agreement and confidence for the proposed wireless AC power monitoring IoT system for in situ monitoring AC appliances with single-phase 110/220 V-AC ratings. Furthermore, the cost of the proposed AC power monitoring module is less than 100 USD, which makes the novel module more cost-effective than commercialized AC power meters which generally cost over 1000 USD. The novelties of the work are the following: (1) the introduction of ADS1114 provides (IC)-C-2 interface directly for Wi-Fi module to reduce the capital cost of the proposed wireless AC power monitoring module; (2) the sufficient confidence of the proposed AC power monitoring IoT system has been validated with closeness of agreement as compared to the commercialized CM3286-1 AC Power Meters. These make the assessment action of environmental, social, and governance (EGS) for stakeholders much more feasible with the advantages of cost-effectiveness and sufficient confidence., "In order to increase the precision and effectiveness of power system analysis and fault diagnosis, this study aims to assess the power systems in the energy sector while utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental social governance (ESG). First, the ESG framework is presented in this study to fully account for the effects of the power system on the environment, society, and governance. Second, to coordinate the operation of various components and guarantee the balance and security of the power system, the CNN-BiLSTM power load demand forecasting model is built by merging convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). Lastly, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to introduce and optimize the deep belief network (DBN), and a power grid fault diagnostic model is implemented using the PSO technique and DBN. The models performance is assessed through experimentation. The outcomes demonstrate how the CNN-BiLSTM algorithm significantly increases forecasting accuracy while overcoming the drawback of just having one dimension of power load data. The values of 0.054, 0.076, and 0.102, respectively, are the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Effective processing of large-scale nonlinear data is achieved in the area of power grid fault diagnosis, resulting in prediction accuracy of 96.22% and prediction time of only 129.94 s. This is clearly better than other algorithms and increases fault prediction efficiency and accuracy. Consequently, the model presented in this study not only produces impressive results in fault diagnosis and load demand forecasting, but also advances the field of power system analysis in the energy industry and offers a significant amount of support for the sustainable and intelligent growth of the energy industry.", "The randomness and volatility of existing clean energy sources have increased the complexity of grid scheduling. To address this issue, this work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) empowered method based on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) big data platform, focusing on multi-objective scheduling optimization for clean energy. This work employs a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enhance grid scheduling efficiency and clean energy utilization. First, the work analyzes the complexity and uncertainty challenges faced in clean energy scheduling within the current power system, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods in handling multi-objective optimization and real-time response. Consequently, the work introduces the ESG big data platform and leverages its abundant data resources and computational power to improve the scheduling decision-making process. Next, PSO is used for initial scheduling optimization and a mathematical model for clean energy scheduling optimization is constructed. To further enhance the dynamic response capability of the scheduling process, this work designs a dual-layer architecture. Among this architecture, DQN is responsible for adjusting the PSO initially optimized scheduling plan based on real-time data during the actual scheduling process, adapting it to the instantaneous change demand and renewable energy output characteristics. Finally, to verify the models effectiveness, this work conducts simulation analyses using real data from the state grid ESG big data platform. The results indicate that this method significantly improves clean energy utilization, increasing it from 62.4% (with traditional methods) to 87.7%, while reducing scheduling costs by 22%. With the increase in communication delay, the generation time of scheduling instruction increases significantly. This is because the algorithm needs to wait longer to receive the complete grid status information, which affects the generation speed of scheduling instructions. Moreover, this method demonstrates good adaptability and stability under different load demands and clean energy supply conditions. This work introduces a novel and efficient method for clean energy scheduling optimization by integrating PSO and DQN.

This paper proposes a new metric to be used in the S space to assess improvements in aspects such as gender equality and cultural diversity in real estate. It adds to the S metrics currently available to see the more effective delivery of the S dimension into real estate investment decision-making.Design/methodology/approachA new S metric in ESG is proposed and validated. Using this metric, examples regarding gender equality and cultural diversity are assessed among leading real estate players in Australia. This S metric is assessed over a number of time periods to demonstrate the improvements in gender equality and cultural diversity in these major real estate players.FindingsThis new S metric is seen to be highly effective and robust in capturing the changes in various aspects of the S dimension in ESG in the real estate space today; particularly concerning gender equality and cultural diversity. It is clearly able to demonstrate the significant changes in increased participation of women at the more senior leadership levels by leading players in the real estate space.Practical implicationsWith ESG becoming a critical issue in the real estate sector, issues involved in the S space will take on increased significance going forward. This is critical, as the elements of the S dimension such as gender equality and cultural diversity are important aspects for an effectively functioning real estate industry. The S metric developed in this paper can be used for benchmarking purposes over time, as well as between real estate players, between sub-sections within a real estate organisation, and comparing against other industry sectors. It is also relevant in all organisations, and is not just limited to the real estate sector. Additional metrics in the S space are an important development to further empirically assess the effective delivery of the S dimension of ESG in the real estate sector and more broadly.Originality/valueThis paper specifically proposes this new S metric in ESG in the real estate industry. This is a key issue for the real estate industry going forward at all levels, as it will facilitate a more diverse real estate industry and more effective real estate investment decision-making. This S metric is applicable in all organisational sectors where the S dimension of ESG is important., Purpose Environment, social, governance (ESG) has taken on increased importance in real estate investment in recent years, with benchmarking ESG being critically important for more informed real estate investment decision-making. Using 60 stakeholder interviews with senior real estate executives, this paper examines the strategic issues regarding benchmarking ESG in real estate investment; specifically, identifying areas going forward where ESG benchmarks need to be improved. This includes the issues of granularity, climate resilience and climate risk, as well as an increased focus on outcomes and performance, and using best practice procedures in delivering ESG in real estate investment.Design/methodology/approachIn total, 60 stakeholder interviews were conducted with key real estate players globally to assess the use of ESG benchmarking in real estate investment at various levels (asset/fund-level, listed real estate, delivery, reporting and internal benchmarking), across regions and across different types of real estate investment players (real estate fund manager, real estate investment trust (REIT), institutional investor and real estate advisor). This enabled key strategic insights to be identified for improved ESG benchmarking practices in real estate investment going forward.FindingsThere was clear evidence of the need for improved benchmarks for ESG in real estate investment. More focus was needed on performance, outcomes and impacts, with a stronger focus on granularity around the issues of climate resilience and climate risk. Improvements in Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), as well as increased attention to Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) were seen as important initiatives. Clear differences were also seen in the use of these ESG benchmarks on a regional basis; with Australia and Europe seen as the world leaders. These strategic stakeholder insights regarding ESG saw the development of best practice guidelines for the more effective delivery of ESG benchmarks for more informed real estate investment decision-making, as well as a series of recommendations for improving ESG benchmarking in real estate investment.Practical implicationsESG benchmarking is a critical area of real estate investment decision-making today. By utilising stakeholder interviews, the strategic insights from key players in the real estate investment space are identified. In particular, this paper identifies how the current ESG benchmarks used in real estate investment need to be improved for a more critical assessment of climate resilience and climate risk issues at a more granular level. This enables the identification and delivery of more effective ESG best practice procedures and recommendations for improving ESG benchmarking in real estate investment going forward. These issues have clear impacts on ongoing capital raisings by investors, where benchmarking ESG is an increasingly important factor for real estate investors, tenants and real estate asset managers.Originality/valueBased on the stakeholder interview responses, this paper has identified key areas for improvement in the current benchmarks for ESG in real estate investment. It is anticipated that an increased focus on technology and the availability of more granular data, coupled with user demand, will see more focus on assessing performance, outcomes and impacts at a real estate asset-specific level and produce a fuller range of ESG metrics, more focused on climate resilience and climate risk. This will see a more effective range of ESG benchmarks for more informed real estate investment decision-making., Purpose Within the context of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance), environmental sustainability has taken on increased global importance in recent years. Similarly, real estate investment managers in developing their global real estate investment portfolios need a fuller understanding of the ESG and environmental sustainability dimensions of these global real estate markets for more informed real estate investment decisions. Using the JLL GRETI sustainability sub-index, this paper examines the environmental sustainability transparency status of 99 global real estate markets over 2016-2020 and explores various strategic issues regarding ESG and environmental sustainability; particularly the critical issues relating to climate risk mitigation, climate resilience and zero-carbon. The current status of environmental sustainability in these 99 real estate markets is assessed, with areas for "best practice" improvement identified to the benefit of real estate investment managers; particularly the improvements needed in ESG to support real estate investment in the emerging real estate markets. Design/methodology/approach The JLL GRETI sustainability sub-index is analysed to examine strategic issues relating to environmental sustainability transparency. 99 real estate markets are assessed globally for a range of critical ESG issues over 2016-2020. Differences between the developed and emerging real estate markets are highlighted. Findings Considerable variation was seen in the ESG and environmental sustainability practices, procedures and frameworks across these 99 real estate markets. This was particularly evident amongst the emerging real estate markets. Compared to the other five dimensions for real estate market transparency, environmental sustainability was seen to be well behind these other dimensions in most markets. Progress has been made in recent years, but it has been slow and steady rather than at a dynamic level. Clearly, more is needed globally to enhance the stature of environmental sustainability in the context of an increasing focus on ESG and specifically on climate risk mitigation, climate resilience and zero-carbon in real estate investment. Practical implications With ESG and environmental sustainability taking on increased importance across the international real estate markets, it is important that real estate fund managers have a full understanding of the ESG and environmental sustainability status of these real estate markets where they may be considering real estate investment opportunities; this includes both the developed and emerging real estate markets. This is essential to ensure future capital raising for new funds, as well as supporting the global ESG agenda by the real estate investment community. Specific strategies are also identified for emerging real estate markets to improve their environmental sustainability practices and ESG status. Originality/value This is the first paper to use the JLL GRETI sustainability sub-index to assess the environmental sustainability status of 99 real estate markets globally; providing strategic insights for real estate investment managers as they develop their global real estate portfolios and more fully embrace the challenges of ESG and environmental sustainability in the real estate space going forward. Specific strategies are clearly identified for all markets to improve their environmental sustainability ratings to the benefit of both global real estate investment and the broader communities.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The analysis uses data from 2016 to 2020 on A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and three panel methodologies: pooled ordinary least squares, random effects, and fixed effects models. The results show that not all ESG dimensions are equally associated with tax avoidance, and the relationship between ESG and tax avoidance differs between well- and poorly governed firms. For well-governed firms, the social and governance dimensions positively correlate with tax avoidance, whereas the environmental dimension does not. For poorly governed firms, none of the three dimensions correlate with tax avoidance. These findings suggest that ESG and tax avoidance are more compatible than conflicting. Moreover, they underscore the importance of good corporate governance in enabling tax avoidance as an ESG-compatible strategy. This study addresses the debatable relationship between ESG and tax avoidance, which has significant implications for stakeholders, including managers, investors, and policymakers., PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the relationship between corporate tax avoidance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and the moderating effect of financial constraints on the relationship between corporate tax avoidance and ESG performance.Design/methodology/approachThe sample consists of a global data set involving 24,259 firm-year observations from 49 countries for the years 2011-2020. Corporate ESG performance was extracted from the Thomson Reuters database. The book-tax difference model was used for measuring corporate tax avoidance, while financially constrained firms were identified using the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index.FindingsThe results show that firms with higher tax avoidance are associated with higher ESG performance, but lower ESG performance is shown for firms with higher financial constraints. The results further indicate that the positive impact of corporate tax avoidance on ESG performance becomes weaker for firms with higher financial constraints.Practical implicationsThe findings imply that policymakers and regulators should focus on mechanisms to promote more internal funds to assist firms in pursuing ESG-related initiatives, such as through tax incentives. Investors should understand the "smokescreen" effect of corporate tax avoidance on ESG performance, especially for firms with financial constraints.Originality/valueThis analysis provides international evidence on the link between tax avoidance and ESG and considers the joint effect of pressures for internal funds, through tax and financing constraints, on corporate ESG performance., "Tax laws may promote practices that lead to tax deductions or deferrals over time and that relate to corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures. This study analyses whether transactions that have corporate tax effects are related to tax avoidance or are a way of channeling ESG commitments. In addition, we investigate whether the firm financial situation moderates the incidence of ESG disclosure on tax practices. The results show that ESG disclosure have a positive impact on permanent tax differences, which are produced by philanthropic, among others. However, the effect of ESG disclosure on temporary differences, which can be related to tax avoidance practices, is negative. Companies committed to ESG do not engage in tax avoidance. Regarding the moderating effect of financial indicators, the results show that only profitability positively moderates the relationship between ESG disclosure and temporary tax differences. ESG disclosure could be used to hide tax avoidance practices. The findings have important implications for policymakers, supporting the creation of effective regulations that incorporate companies tax practices into the ESG objectives. This will encourage companies to be more conscientious about their tax behaviors."

This study is based on an analysis of 188 comment letters submitted by such actors in the context of public consultations on the development of three new sustainable finance initiatives (the CFA Institute, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, and the New Zealand parliament). The study shows these actors nuanced and often quite critical perceptions of the effectiveness of external assurance in preventing greenwashing and their reservations about its mandatory nature. These actors have raised various criticisms, including concerns about the vagueness surrounding verification practices; the lack of expertise available to conduct assurance in a new, specialized, and complex field; the costs of the assurance process, particularly for small players; and the lack of control over the reliability of the ESG data used. This article contributes to several emerging trends in the literature-in particular, research on governance practices to prevent greenwashing, on the institutionalization of sustainable finance standards and laws, and on the role of rational myths in the assurance process for ESG disclosures.", Sustainability reporting has proliferated in recent years, but compliance remains a work in progress. Since "comply-or- explain" sustainability reporting was introduced by the Singapore Exchange in 2016, no regulator has yet to exercise oversight or enforcement over the quality of such reports. Instead, the key player is an investor organisation focused on minority investor protection, the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS). This article critically analyses SIAS\s engagement strategy on sustainability reporting. Despite owning no shares and having neither shareholder nor regulatory power, SIAS engages with management at annual general meetings. Nonetheless, SIAS engagement has been measured and limited, and never addressed climate change. The "persuasion without power" strategy adopted by SIAS in Singapore may be of interest to activists in other jurisdictions that prize action on immediate firm-specific environmental, social and governance issues over broader matters such as climate change., Sustainability reporting has proliferated in recent years, but compliance remains a work in progress.

Instead, the key player is an investor organisation focused on minority investor protection, the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS). This article critically analyses SIAS\s engagement strategy on sustainability reporting. Despite owning no shares and having neither shareholder nor regulatory power, SIAS engages with management at annual general meetings. Nonetheless, SIAS engagement has been measured and limited, and never addressed climate change. The "persuasion without power" strategy adopted by SIAS in Singapore may be of interest to activists in other jurisdictions that prize action on immediate firm-specific environmental, social and governance issues over broader matters such as climate change.

A total of 24 510 votes cast by 17 local investment management companies in 2013 were analysed. Interviews were also conducted with selected investment managers to gain more insight into the proxy voting process at their companies. Based on this data, it was concluded that investment managers preferred to engage with investee companies in private and viewed proxy voting as the last link in the shareholder activism chain. As a result, only 6.6 per cent of all votes were against resolutions tabled by 347 JSE-listed companies in 2013. Resolutions regarding shareholders endorsement of companies remuneration policies; the election and re-election of directors, particularly those serving on audit committees; and the issuance of ordinary shares elicited the most opposition. Companies that were excluded from the JSEs Socially Responsible Investment Index in 2013 attracted significantly more opposition than their counterparts who were included in the index when seeking shareholder approval on the election and re-election of directors and the placing of shares under the control of directors. The same applied to companies that had low environmental, social and governance disclosure scores in 2013 as regards the issuance of shares. It is recommended, amongst others, that shareholder activism in South Africa be promoted by enhancing investor education and effecting some regulatory changes.", We study how corporate social responsibility relates to investors, firms, and shareholder proposals. We examine shareholder proposals on environmental, social, and governance issues at the annual general meeting of shareholders with US Fortune 250 firms during 2011-2014. We find that the probability of receiving shareholder proposals on environmental issues is positively associated with responsible institutional ownership. We find no systematic evidence that the outperformance regarding social responsibility of the firms themselves would significantly matter regarding the likelihood of shareholders filing proposals about corporate social responsibility, except for employee wellbeing.

Using corporate political spending disclosures as our setting, we conduct a detailed inquiry of 541 political spending-related shareholder proposals from 2004 to 2012 to highlight the role of shareholder activism as a mechanism to motivate ESG disclosure. Unlike earlier studies, we examine both proposals that went to a vote and proposals that were withdrawn by the activist, allowing us to assess more comprehensively the success of shareholder activism. We find that 20 percent of firms targeted by disclosure proposals begin disclosing in the subsequent year, although implementation rates vary by proposal type-8 percent for proposals subject to a vote versus 56 percent for proposals withdrawn. The sponsor is also important: unions and public pension funds are less likely than other activists to target firms with agency problems and are less successful in having proposals withdrawn, and the implementations they obtain are viewed more negatively by the broader investor base. Our findings highlight shareholder proposals as one mechanism through which investors can successfully express their preferences for corporate disclosure policies. Given activists long-standing interest in environmental and social disclosure policies, we believe our findings generalize to a broader set of ESG disclosures."
